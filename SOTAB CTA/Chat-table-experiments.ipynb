They travel the island together, learning much along the way. This is an enjoyable guide for children that raises awareness of threats to marine life.||\\nSiapa Cepat Dia Dapat (The Early Bird Catches the Worm) || In a variation of the age-old precept “The early bird catches the worm,” this simple tale features a little crow named Yaya who loved to wake up late while his family and friends were searching for food. One evening, after scouring for food unsuccessfully, he realised the value of starting the day early and working hard like the rest.||\\nOnce in a Village… || The wise elders warned the villagers against cutting down the trees in the forest to make way for more houses and fields to grow food, but they did not listen. The rain did not come that year, or the years after that. Through the villagers’ suffering, this story illustrates the importance of conserving and giving thanks to nature.||\\nA River of Stories: Tales and Poems from across the Commonwealth || This is a retelling of stories of magical life-sustaining water, revolving around animals, people, rivers, rain and water gods. Hermit crabs having a tug of war on Sri Lanka’s shores, water gods debating who is the most powerful, these are some of the beautifully illustrated stories reflecting the rich tradition of Commonwealth countries.||\\nIn the Forest || Deep in the Amazonian rainforest, everything is so green and full of life until the ‘metal monsters’ intrude in. This creative pop-up book tells the dramatic story of one sloth who hangs on in the forest because of its laziness, as a result, witnesses the whole process of the forest being destroyed and then reborn. This book effectively presents to the readers the horrible results of wanton deforestation and conveys a clear message for environmental protection.||\\n'],\n",

Into this creative chaos came Google with its dazzling mission—“To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible”—and its much-quoted motto, “Don’t be evil.” In this provocative book, Siva Vaidhyanathan examines the ways we have used and embraced Google—and the growing resistance to its expansion across the globe. He exposes the dark side of our Google fantasies, raising red flags about issues of intellectual property and the much-touted Google Book Search. He assesses Google’s global impact, particularly in China, and explains the insidious effect of Googlization on the way we think. Finally, Vaidhyanathan proposes the construction of an Internet ecosystem designed to benefit the whole world and keep one brilliant and powerful company from falling into the “evil” it pledged to avoid.||\\n324.08 || Amit Sheth Semantic web continues to be an increasingly important system for allowing end-users to share and communicate information online.||\\n$66.50 || Library Relocations and Collection Shift By Dennis C.

With unnatural strength and inexplicable speed, the family is dangerous. Despite the feeling in his gut, Jack can't resist the mysterious Mara Maitland. When he uncovers her secret, it does nothing to deter his craving for the woman. As the clan's first female enforcer, Mara's job is simple: protect her pack at all costs. But the unattached males in her clan refuse to accept her as anything other than an advantageous mate. And now, with the multi-national corporation, Denon, determined to exploit them for their gain, Mara is forced to team up with her least-favorite human, Jack Buchanan to protect her species.

This brochure promotes what was to be the second year of this glamorous service. Unfortunately the Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed on May 6, 1937, as she touched the mooring mast at Lakehurst on her first inbound flight of 1937. This promotional piece anticipated that \\\\\"Vacationists, families, businessmen will seize this 1937 opportunity to travel by air\\\\\" through some 18 scheduled sailings from Lakehurst.

Nicholas Wolterstorff explores why this is, and offers an alternative framework according to which arts are a part of social practice, and have different meaning in different practices. Human beings engage works of the arts in many different ways: they sing songs while working, they kiss icons, they create and dedicate memorials. Yet almost all philosophers of art of the modern period have ignored this variety and focused entirely on just one mode of engagement, namely, disinterested attention. In the first part of the book Nicholas Wolterstorff asks why philosophers have concentrated on just this one mode of engagement. The answer he proposes is that almost all philosophers have accepted what the author calls the grand narrative concerning art in the modern world. It is generally agreed that in the early modern period, members of the middle class in Western Europe increasingly engaged works of the arts as objects of disinterested attention. The grand narrative claims that this change represented the arts coming into their own, and that works of art, so engaged, are||\\nBritish music & drama education yearbook 2019-20 || en || ||\\nAn illustrated history of British theatre and performance.: Volume 2, From the Industrial Revolution to the Digital Age || en || An Illustrated History of British Theatre and Performance chronicles the history and development of theatre from the Roman era to the present day.

They hit the ground running and pulled no punches after these heroes figured out their purpose. With that said, the big hype for Psi-Lords #7 was that one would die by the end of the issue, but I loved that there was so much more to take from the chapter than that. With each passing issue, and with greater clarity, the momentum picked up and took us along for the ride. All to this point where it is quite literally all or nothing for our cosmic heroes to save Earth from this catastrophic collision. Before I get into the story, I'm going to again praise the decision-making from Renato Guedes as the artist. This could have been a very okay book from a visual standpoint, but he really stepped up when he backed away from his usual painted style. He did this and allowed us the full experience that is not only bold and flashy colors, but being able to properly take in the story that these characters should be||\\nWhat's up everyone! Welcome to Beyond The Panel. Coming at you today with talk about Undiscovered Country #5! As I said before, the events of Undiscovered Country #4 made this a book you will want to stick with to the bitter end. Just when you thought you had things figured out, just like that you find out that you really knew nothing. A great feeling to get so lost in a mystery which only runs deeper and deeper. Not to mention gets more dangerous the deeper you go. This issue picked up right where the previous left off. With the two siblings carrying out this deal with the Destiny Man in order to take the next steps towards finding their dad. While it has felt like their arguments go in circles, there was still something to appreciate about the context of it all. Especially when it comes to both arguing who is more selfish. The one who put his own mission above the lives of everyone else, or the one who put her job above the finding the truth of what happened to her own parents. When they got past that, there was only what would happen once these two||\\nWith war on the rise, the future is looking a bit bleak for the heroes of this universe. As I said before, these are our gods among men struggling to beat back a team that you wouldn't have originally blinked twice at. If you came here looking for that easy win that we tend to poke fun at the Justice League for being capable of, you were corrected of this multiple times throughout this run. That's honestly what makes this so exciting. Even if you know the tides are not in favor of the heroes currently, you still brace yourself for the unexpected. Especially in a world where villains big and small are now equipped with the very resources they need to be truly formidable. Now with that said, it was surprising that at this stage in the game we had a Jarro issue to look forward to. Not that Jarro hasn't been important to the team, but you couldn't know what kind of impact he could have through an issue focused on him primarily. Off the bat, I appreciated the story of Starro that they decided to tell in this issue. If you are someone like me, then you||\\nWhat's up everyone! Welcome to Beyond The Panel. Coming at you today with talk about Strikeforce #8! This was another books which made me feel like it was ages since the last issue I read of it. In fact, I almost forgot this book was even still ongoing till this week. That was how long this wait had felt. I honestly had to take a bit of a refresher before jumping into this issue. You know, just in case this wasn't one of those issues where they were going to give a recap before things began again. That said, I was still looking forward to what this new situation had in store for the team. I say this particularly because the last place anyone who isn't a dark elf would want to find themselves is in a place like Svartalfheim. It was actually surprising that this was where the story would eventually take us. Bold if you ask me considering depending on how much you know about the events of the 'War of Ten Realms', they could easily lose you in this situation creating more questions than answers. Fortunately, that was not the case here. All you really needed to||\\nWhat's up everyone! Welcome to Beyond The Panel. Coming at you today with talk about DCeased: Unkillables #1! I have to say I was ecstatic when the announcement came that there would be another part to this story. When I finished the first book, I told myself I would not forgive them if things ended the way they did. There was no way you could build-up a world like this and a disaster like this and not go deeper into it. So when DCeased: Unkillables was announced, I was thrilled for another opportunity to jump back into this madness. The best thing that a book like this has going for it is the fact that you have no idea what you are getting yourself into. You didn't with the first book, and the same could be said about DCeased: Unkillables. Even already knowing that this series returns to answer this question: What did the villains do when the heroes failed and the world ended? Was not enough. Still just about anything could happen within these pages whether it ends with the villains finding some way to survive this world, or they perish along with every other ounce of hope.

With her career (and life) directed by her manager, Ray, she hasn’t had to worry about a thing for more than a decade…not where she goes, not what she sings, not who she is. But when Ray has a heart attack, Sophie is left without the only real father figure she’s ever known and questioning everything she believes about what’s important to her. Enter Dana Landon, the new manager sent by Sophie’s record company. Dana is gorgeous, sophisticated, and ready to do her job keeping Sophie’s career on track and making the record company money. Dana captures Sophie’s attention in ways Sophie never expected and isn’t ready for, but after so many years of being told what to do, Sophie’s ready to shake things up with some ideas of her own. Ones Dana hasn’t been planning on and isn’t at all sure she likes. Cover Artist: Ann McMan||\\n2015-11-01 || Movie star Jean Sanders is America's Sweetheart in 1946. She's also a lesbian, which she tries to keep concealed from the prying eyes of her public. She's been very discreet in her encounters until she meets Maggie Crawford, an up-and-coming actress. They fall in love and want to spend every moment together. They devise a guise under which Maggie will move in with Jean to study acting. The ruse works until a reporter snaps a picture of the two of them gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They are told by the studio head that if they continue living together, they'll be fired, so they split up, each afraid of ruining her career. Can they overcome the social mores of the day and find everlasting love?||\\n2020-07-01 || Josephine Wilder’s torrid love affair is with Tangle Valley Vineyard, her family’s legacy. She’s grown up dreaming between the vines. She’s always had secret ideas about how to make the place shine, so when it passes to her, Joey vows to make Tangle Valley everything she knows it can be. Her biggest obstacle? That overly commercial hotel going up, and the uppity manager trying to kill the vineyard’s rustic charm. Becca Crawford loves to unwind with a good glass of wine. An astute business woman who has climbed the hospitality ladder, she’s the perfect person to head up Elite Resorts’ newest property, The Jade Hotel, and give tourists all the luxury they desire. As a bonus, The Jade is not far from the cutest vineyard with the best pinot she’s ever tasted. If only the captivating owner would get on board with her plan and stop badmouthing the hotel to everyone in town. Is it possible that a nice glass of red could help Becca and Joey see each other in a new and alluring light?

When her best friend Ava is injured the night she is scheduled to assist with a hands-on sexual education workshop, Diana is forced to find a short term replacement. The last thing she wants is a new lover, even a paid one. After a year of living in the apartment next door, all Jude Monaco knows about her neighbor Diana is that she’s a gorgeous, older woman and the inspiration for more dirty fantasies than she cares to admit. So when Diana knocks on her door with a shockingly delicious favor to ask, Jude seizes the opportunity to learn more. Their professional relationship is supposed to be a clinical erotic arrangement between a sex therapist and her assistant, but at the intersection of sex and intimacy, anything is possible.

What it is the unexpurgated, shameful but true history of the Democrat Party. Underneath the revisionism and white-washing, this is who they are. It\\'s a dual release - a book and and a film. If you remember, I reviewed D\\'Souza\\'s very interesting Stealing America, so I am quite excited about this new release. Here is the trailer for the film: Doesn\\'t pull any punches, does it? And here\\'s the blurb for the book: Dinesh D’Souza, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller America: Imagine a World Without Her, has a warning: We are on the brink of losing our country forever. After eight years of Obama, four years—or possibly eight years—of Hillary Clinton as president of the United States would so utterly transform America as to make it unrecognizable. No more will America be a land of opportunity. Instead, it will be a land of rapacious crony capitalism, run solely for the benefit of friends of the Obamas and the Clintons and the Democratic Party. It will, in fact, be the fulfillment of a dream the Democratic Party has had from the beginning…a dream||\\nCrisis of Character || Everyone seems to be talking about this book, which will be released at the end of June, which means it will be a hot topic throughout the presidential campaign (assuming Hillary is nominated). Here\\'s the blurb: Former Secret Service officer Gary Byrne exposes the truth behind Hillary, Bill, and their public facade. Posted directly outside President Clinton\\'s Oval Office, Former Secret Service uniformed officer Gary Byrne reveals what he observed of Hillary Clinton\\'s character and the culture inside the White House while protecting the First Family. Now that a second Clinton administration threatens -- their scheme from the very beginning -- Byrne exposes what he saw of the real Hillary Clinton. While serving as a Secret Service Officer, Gary Byrne protected President Bill Clinton and the First Family in the White House and outside the Oval Office. There, he saw the political and personal machinations of Bill and Hillary Clinton and those who were fiercely loyal to them. In CRISIS OF CHARACTER Byrne provides a firsthand account of the scandals--known and unknown--and daily trials ranging from the minor to national in scale. Having witnessed the personal and political dysfunction of the Clinton White House--so consumed by scandal and destroying their enemies, real and imagined--Byrne came to understand that, to the Clintons, governing was an afterthought. He now tells this story--before voters go to the polls--in the hopes that Clinton supporters will understand the real Hillary Clinton.||\\nThomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History || America had just won independence from Britain, but we had, literally, no navy. Washington was determined to to be neutral in international politics, and with the country still recovering, and deeply in debt, from the Revolutionary war, he wanted neither a standing army nor a standing navy. Reality, however, was not very supportive of Washington\\'s policy. Even before he became President, the so-called Barbary Pirates had taken an American merchant ship and enslaved all aboard. Barbary pirates were North-African based raiders that controlled the western Mediterranean sea. For America to engage in Mediterranean trade, they would either have to pay tribute to the Barbary states (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli) or have to find a way to defend their trade ships. Most of the major powers, including Britain and France, paid tribute. America tried that, but being broke, could not afford it. This is where we find out that we are very lucky that we had Thomas Jefferson on our side, first as ambassador, then Secretary of State, and finally as President. I really like how Kilmeade and Yager bring the people involved to life. There\\'s a kindly experienced Captain, a dashing but brash young Lieutenant, a renegade American Muslim This is probably the most relevant history book you can pick up today. Most of us, when we think of American history, think of it the way it is taught in school - a series of events that inevitably leads to certain outcomes, culminating in the America we know today. Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates completely breaks that mid-set. From the first chapter we get the sense of how uncertain America\\'s future was.||\\nThe Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss || Everything you believe about how to lose weight is wrong. Weight gain and obesity are driven by hormones—in everyone—and only by understanding the effects of insulin and insulin resistance can we achieve lasting weight loss. In this highly readable and provocative book, Dr. Jason Fung sets out an original, robust theory of obesity that provides startling insights into proper nutrition. In addition to his five basic steps, a set of lifelong habits that will improve your health and control your insulin levels, Dr. Fung explains how to use intermittent fasting to break the cycle of insulin resistance and reach a healthy weight—for good. The Obesity Code is his first book, where he explains his analysis of obesity, diabetes, the role of insulin and sugar, and why his approach - eliminating sugar and burning off existing sugar in the body through fasting -works. It\\'s not a diet book per se - you won\\'t find a meal plan or recipes. But it is a good book to help you understand why you would want to do this and how to adopt this approach. If you are one of the many people who suffer from weight gain, specially as you age, have diabetics in the family, or have developed Type 2 Diabetes yourself, you should definitely, definitely check out Dr. Fung, whether through his book or via his websites and videos. The good news for those who need detailed guides: Dr. Fung is writing a how-to book which due to come out in October and is already available for pre-order: The Complete Guide To Fasting. This is a best-seller by a Canadian nephrologist, Dr. Jason Fung, who has a large internet following on youtube and on his website: Intensive Dietary Management. He treats diabetics and has been able in some cases to reverse Type 2 Diabetes through diet and fasting. From the blurb:||\\nTears of Paradox || Tears of Paradox is told from the alternating viewpoints of a young working class couple, Jason and Michelle. Michelle\\'s chapters are mostly stream of consciousness thoughts in the present, as she lives in the basement of an older couple, apparently in hiding. She is pregnant, scared, lonely, and often in tears, and frequently praying to the the Blessed Virgin Mary. Jason\\'s chapters are stories of the past, of how he and Michelle grew up together and fell in love, and of their daily struggles. Both points of view are told against the backdrop of a creeping authoritarianism that is bit by bit destroying their lives. An all-encompassing health law has empowered the government \\\\\"sharks\\\\\" to intrude ever more into everyday life. Michelle is telling the story from the end of it, when the sharks have already done their worst. Jason is telling the story from the beginning of it, as the normal challenges of life are turned into heavy blows by a malevolent government. I liked how unabashedly religious the main characters are. Michelle is a devout Catholic while Jason starts out as someone who doesn\\'t care much about religion, but as struggles wear him down he turns more and more to God. I also liked how realistic it felt - the day to day travails were familiar, and the added twists of government intrusion did not seem far-fetched at all. There is a deep sense of foreboding throughout the book. I struggled at first with the structure and style. The storyline does not unfold as a regular narrative, instead memories and anecdotes are revealed out of sequence, often folding back on itself. Also I am not a big fan of being so much||\\n'],\n",

Frantic, Jimmy darts through the traffic; suddenly there’s a dreadful sound, and Jimmy sees Dax’s body lying in the road. Should he carry on running – or go and help?

The brochure, produced in support of the Yuvselbank (The South Peasant Bank) was aimed to the population of the South of Russia and the Caucasus. The decree on the bank nationalisation has been one of the earliest act of the Soviet administration - it has passed on 27th of November, 1917, however in the times of New Economic Policy the desired economic growth would have been impossible without the banking system, so Gosbank has created branches and affiliates throughout the country. There were also banks owned by cooperatives and even ‘societies of the two-way credit’, that acted like the pre-revolutionary banks on the local level. One of the largest sectors of banking in the 1920s was the credits given to the peasants (conducted by TsentrKhozBank).

I think the author wanted to make it entertaining. The author, being a journalist, did a lot of moral judgments, which unexpected given his profession. What happened to the idea of presenting facts and let the reader make their conclusions? Also, I am afraid that all this moralizing will sway some people opposite direction, which is even sadder. While reading the book, I realized that for the last eight years in the tech industry, I knew only a handful of engineers who would blindly believe in the cult of the CEO. Most of the engineers I know are always skeptical about cult figures. It seems to me that for the best part of the last decade, media first build tech CEO into the cult, and then got disappointed with them. But why did they make the cult in the first place? Inside the companies, it never felt like that to me. Again, I’m very disappointed with the book. It covered important issues but delivered them in a terrible and sensationalist way. Also, the author tried to create a story from connecting every available piece of information.||\\nOne of the most beautiful and simple books about life, love, death; about being a child and being an adult; about friendship, people and happiness. When I was in 10th grade at school, I remember literature teacher was very enthusiastic about this book. She was telling us about it all the time. I didn’t find it interesting back then. I didn’t understand the story about little prince, talking foxes, flowers and snakes. Form didn’t appeal to me and I probably had nothing to learn from it at that time. This time was different. I would recommend this book to everyone. It’s a pure beauty. Just in few pages it shows what is important in life and what is not.||\\nMy first book from Zhadan. I like his poetry and songs, but I didn’t like novel at all. Maybe I didn’t understand it, but for me a lot of scenes from this book were too painful to read but it seemed like Zhadan romanticised his experiences and stories. Things that I wanted to forget from my past - those are the things that he cherished. As I said, maybe I misunderstood him, but book didn’t meet my expectations.

Investigating the development of the Mega Man series alongside the rise of video game emulation, the YouTube retrogaming scene, and the soaring price of NES carts, novelist Salvatore Pane takes a close and compelling look at the lost power-ups of our youth that we collect in our attempts to become complete again.||\\n2016-03-29 || Spelunky || When Derek Yu released Spelunky for free in 2008, his roguelike-inspired platformer took the indie game community by storm with its combination of classic platform mechanics, extreme difficulty, and random level generation. Four years later, Spelunky's HD remake went on to become PC Gamer's Game of the Year and earn perfect scores from Polygon and Eurogamer. But how is a ‘perfect’ game made? Spelunky is Boss Fight's first autobiographical book: the story of a game's creation as told by its creator. Using his own game as a vehicle, Derek Yu discusses such wide-ranging topics as randomization, challenge, indifferent game worlds, player feedback, development team dynamics, and what's required to actually finish a game. Grab some ropes, a mattock, and your favorite pug—this book is going to dig deep.||\\n2014-06-02 || ZZT || In 1991, long before Epic Games was putting out blockbusters like Unreal, Infinity Blade, and Gears of War, Tim Sweeney released a strange little MS-DOS shareware game called ZZT. The simplicity of its text graphics masked the complexity of its World Editor: players could use ZZT to design their own games. This feature was a revelation to thousands of gamers, including Anna Anthropy, author of Rise of the Videogame Zinesters. ZZT is an exploration of a submerged continent, a personal history of the shareware movement, ascii art, messy teen identity struggle, cybersex, transition, outsider art, the thousand deaths of Barney the Dinosaur, and what happens when a ten-year-old gets her hands on a programming language she can understand. It’s been said that the first Velvet Underground album sold only a few thousand copies, but that everyone who heard it formed a band. Well not everyone has played ZZT, but everyone who played it became a game designer.||\\n2014-04-01 || Chrono Trigger || When Boss Fight Books first gave fans the chance to vote for the game they most wanted to read a book about, they chose the epic time travel RPG Chrono Trigger. Featuring new interviews with translator Ted Woolsey and DS retranslator Tom Slattery, Michael P. Williams's book delves deep into connections between Crono’s world and ours, including Chrono Trigger's take on institutions such as law and religion, how the game's heroes fit and defy genre conventions, and the maddening logical headaches inherent in any good time travel plot. From the Magus dilemma to the courtroom scene, find out why many consider this game the high point in the entire role-playing genre in this in-depth examination of Chrono Trigger, a ton of fun and a true work of art.||\\n2014-07-01 || Galaga || For fifteen seconds of one of the highest-grossing films of all time, The Avengers’ plan to save the world comes to a grinding halt when Tony Stark calls out a low-level member of S.H.I.E.L.D. for playing Galaga on the job. Acclaimed novelist and lifelong Galaga player Michael Kimball knows the compulsion: He’s set and re-set high scores on Galaga machines all across America. What many call the greatest fixed shooter arcade game in history, Galaga broke the Space Invaders mold with superior graphics, faster firing, bonus rounds, tractor beams, and advanced enemy A.I. Since its 1981 release, Galaga has inspired numerous sequels, bootlegs, hacks, and clones—and some version of Galaga has been released for nearly every gaming platform. Kimball shares his obsession with Galaga through a discussion of the innovative gameplay it introduced (including lots of tips), its extensive cultural legacy (including collectibles, movies, rap songs, drinking games, and sex acts), and how Galaga got Kimball through a difficult childhood--and maybe saved his life.||\\n\"],\n",

Love, Department of Educational Theory & Practice, University of Georgia || “This collection, expertly edited by the emerging and ambitious scholar Aria Halliday, is both an inoculation and an antidote, as well as a testament to the exponential power of Black girlhood studies. Her curation of ten thoughtful essays embraces the international bounds of Black girls’ racialized and sexualized childhoods and makes it mentally as well as intellectually recognizable for avid readers, educators, activists, and social scientists. The text is a savvy reframing of the too-often denied legibility of Black girls’ worthiness—their need for protection, play, security, imagination, and prevention from harm. It also authorizes the leaders who grant voice and agency to girls (rather than women) in scholarly pursuits. The Black Girlhood Studies Collection is its own world-making of the past, present, and future, reshaping the context in which Black girls can finally shine.” —Dr. Kyra D. Gaunt, University at Albany, SUNY, and author of The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-Dutch to Hip-Hop, a prize-winning book that contributed to the emergence of hip-hop feminism and black girlhood studies “The field of Black Girlhood Studies deserves a book this beautiful, this powerful, and this affirming. Halliday has put together a collection of works that truly loves Black girls. Each chapter is unique and interdisciplinary. It asks us to explore how we understand Black girlhood today. Don’t just read this book: deeply study it. The collective knowledge within these pages will push the field and our communities for years to come.” —Dr. Bettina L. Love, Department of Educational Theory & Practice, University of Georgia “This groundbreaking collection brings together some of the most brilliant emerging and leading scholars in Black Girlhood Studies.

Julia, Eddie and Steph are making separate journeys to Ireland to attend the wedding of their beloved Annie, the woman who fostered each of them in their childhoods and to spend the weekend in the house that gave them all shelter when they needed it most. All three are now adults — Julia, a world famous singer living in luxury in Paris; Eddie, a chef in London; and Steph who spends her days on a remote Greek island, running a writers’ retreat with her older lover — but as the wedding celebrations get underway, certain truths come to light which show that past hurts have yet to heal. As Annie says ‘I do’, the three make some discoveries about themselves — but will the guests of the wedding party get their happy-ever-after in time for Christmas day? It’s that Time of Year is the spellbinding, warm-hearted new novel from one of Ireland’s best-loved writers.||\\n2020-06-11 || A moving and nostalgic saga about post office girls in wartime London. Perfect for readers of Katie Flynn, Kitty Neale and Dilly Court. It is autumn 1940 and, as the bombs rain down on London, a close-knit community struggles to survive. Working at the local post office, Bessie Green does her best to keep her customers’ spirits up, but when she receives a telegram addressed to her parents, there’s nothing she can do to prevent the heartache that lies ahead. Then Bessie hears that eleven-year-old Daisy Mason has been orphaned in a blast, and she’s sure that taking Daisy into their home is just what her parents need to help them overcome their grief. At first, Daisy won’t settle, then her handsome brother Josh comes back on leave and things look up for all of them. But the war brings further challenges for Bessie and her friends – with more hearts broken and loved-ones lost – before they can dare to dream of a brighter future… Readers love Pam Evans heartwarming family sagas: ‘A touching novel’ Daily Express ‘An unforgettable tale of life during the war’ Our Time ‘Nostalgia, heartbreak, danger and war: all the ingredients of an engrossing novel‘||\\n2008-06-05 || Phoebe MacNamara first comes face to face with Duncan Swift high up on a roof, as she tries to stop one of his ex-employees from jumping to his death. As Savannah’s chief hostage negotiator, Phoebe is calm, courageous, and ready to risk her life to save others. But this chance meeting with Duncan will bring dramatic repercussions for them both. When Phoebe is brutally assaulted in her precinct house she realizes that someone is out to destroy her – both professionally and personally. With Duncan’s support, Phoebe must discover just who is pursuing her, before it’s too late . . .||\\n2020-08-06 || The music, the fans, the choreography, the clothes, the merch, the hysteria… the hair. The pop phenomenon that dominated the 1990s and 2000s has left a long-lasting mark on culture, yet no book has fully celebrated them. Maria Sherman has a deep love of boy bands and has written extensively on them for Jezebel, where she currently works, as well as in Rolling Stone, Vulture, and more. In this book, her first, she celebrates the boy band revolution with a mix of serious fandom and a tongue-in-cheek attitude. Larger Than Life begins with a brief look at the history of boy bands starting with The Beatles and touching on groups from the 1970s and early 1980s like the Jackson 5 and Menudo. Sherman then moves on the heart of the book — the boy bands of the 80s, 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. Bands including NKOTB, Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, One Direction, and K-Pop bands like BTS are given a capsule biography with spreads on solo careers (the good and the bad), one hit wonders, dating, in-fighting, haters, and more mini-essays interspersed throughout. Informative and funny but never fan-shaming, Larger Than Life is the ultimate nostalgic guide to the musical genre and||\\n2019-11-14 || A frontline witness account of the deadly urban combat of the Battle of Mosul told by former Navy SEAL and frontline combat medic Ephraim Mattos. After leaving the US Navy SEAL teams in spring of 2017, Ephraim Mattos, age twenty-four, flew to Iraq to join a small group of volunteer humanitarians known as the Free Burma Rangers, who were working on the frontlines of the war on ISIS. Until being shot by ISIS on a suicidal rescue mission, Mattos witnessed unexplainable acts of courage and sacrifice by the Free Burma Rangers, who, while under heavy machine gun and mortar fire, assaulted across ISIS minefields, used themselves as human shields, and sprinted down ISIS-infested streets-all to retrieve wounded civilians. In City of Death: Humanitarian Warriors in the Battle of Mosul, Mattos recounts in vivid detail what he saw and felt while he and the other Free Burma Rangers evacuated the wounded, conducted rescue missions, and at times fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Iraqi Army against ISIS. Filled with raw and emotional descriptions of what it’s like to come face-to-face with death, this is the harrowing and uplifting true story of a small group of men who risked everything to save the lives||\\n'],\n",

A.||\\nLady Gregory, Fifty Years After || £38.00 || It is now over fifty years since the death of Augusta Gregory, who as a playwright, folklorist, essayist, poet, translator, editor, theatre administrator and nationalist, contributed so much and so uniquely to the realisation of modern Ireland. Yet soon after her death she seemed to be virtually forgotten, and the words on her gravestone – ‘she shall be remembered for ever’ – had a very hollow ring about them. It has only been in the last twenty-five years that Lady Gregory’s reputation has turned round, beginning with Elizabeth Coxhead’s biography, and the subsequent appearance of the Coole Edition of her works. The publication of Mary Lou Kohfeldt's biography in 1985 and now the appearance of this volume – the first collection of essays to be devoted to her – must surely create a greater awareness of her importance as a cornerstone of the Irish Literary Revival. Her books and plays, together with her work for the Abbey as manager, playwright, play-reader and fund-raiser, have had an influence on the literary life of Ireland in the first half of this century that has been greatly underestimated. This collection opens with fragments of memory about Lady Gregory, and then brings together leading||\\nIrish Literature and Culture || £25.00 || 21.6 x 13.8 cm. x, 196 pp. 1992 Irish Literary Studies series (ISSN 0140-895X) volume 35 This volume deals with the illumination of literature through the study of other art forms. A diverse and absorbing variety of subjects are called in aid of literary analysis, including music, aesthetics, politics, rebellion, ritual, stage design, painting, sociology, cinema, and colonisation. The essays are adapted from papers given at the 1988 Conference of the Canadian Association for Irish Studies in Montreal, entitled `Cultural and Artistic Contexts of Irish Literature'. Two essays, by Andrew Carpenter and Mary Helen Thuente, have been added to lend completeness to the collection. The other contributors are: Zack Bowen, Richard Allen Cave, Terry Egleton, John Wilson Foster, Richard Kearney, Declan Kiberd, Edna Longley, Patrick Rafroidi and Wolfgang Zach, with the conference opening address by Hiroshi Suzuki.

Theatre of Shadows both defines and takes as its subject the middle period of Samuel Beckett's dramatic writing. By making a close study of the structure, and of the largely unpublished manus-cript drafts, of the plays written from 1956 to 1976, this book offers considerable insight into Beckett's creative process. A combination of rigorous patterning and a movement away from concrete expression (what Beckett himself called a 'vaguening' of the text) is seen to be his customary working method during this period. Dr Pountney goes on to discuss how the plays work in the theatre, through a detailed analysis of Beckett's stagecraft. In order to set the middle period in context some discussion of Beckett's early work for the theatre is included, and a final chapter on the late plays shows his dramatic imagination still finding new channels to explore. The book provides the student with as comprehensive||\\nAngelica Kauffmann: A Biography || £30.00 || ISBN: 978-0-900675-68-3 23.4 x 15.5 cm. iv, 192 pp. + 15 colour illus, and 24pp. b/w illus. Angelica Kauffmann (1741-1807) was considered by her contemporaries to be one of the greatest and most influential artists of her time, but since then her reputation has fluctuated. With the present revival of interest in the neo-classical era, Angelica is now regaining her true position in the opinions of the critics and art historians. This fact was underlined by the great exhibition of her work at Bregenz in 1968 and by the appearance of several of her works in the 1972 Burlington House exhibition which has the neo-classical as its theme. As one of the foremost writers in the Bregenz catalogue, Anthony M. Clarke, has written to the author of this work, ‘Angelica Kauffmann’s best paintings are of a lasting greatness and value’. Dorothy Moulton Mayer’s previous biographies of Louise of Savoy and Marie Antoinette have well fitted her to write about this artist. Only a woman can really appreciate the difficulties under which Angelica laboured, in spite of her success, and the author has written a biography which shows her to be in full sympathy with her subject.

His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors. Sedaris is an amazing reader whose appearances draw hundreds, and his performancesincluding a jaw-dropping impression of Billie Holiday singing I wish I were an Oscar Meyer weinerare unforgettable. Sedariss essays on living in Paris are some of the funniest hes ever written. At last, someone even meaner than the French! The sort of blithely sophisticated, loopy humour that might have resulted if Dorothy Parker and James Thurber had had a love child. Entertainment Weekly on Barrel Fever Sidesplitting Not one of the essays in this new collection failed to crack me up; frequently I was helpless. The New York Times Book Review||\\nNaked || In Naked, David Sedaris’s message alternately rendered in Fakespeare, Italian, Spanish, and pidgin Greek is the same: pay attention to me. Whether he’s taking to the road with a thieving quadriplegic, sorting out the fancy from the extra-fancy in a bleak fruit-packing factory, or celebrating Christmas in the company of a recently paroled prostitute, this collection of memoirs creates a wickedly incisive portrait of an all-too-familiar world. It takes Sedaris from his humiliating bout with obsessive behavior in A Plague of Tics to the title story, where he is finally forced to face his naked self in the mirrored sunglasses of a lunatic. At this soulful and moving moment, he picks potato chip crumbs from his pubic hair and wonders what it all means. This remarkable journey into his own life follows a path of self-effacement and a lifelong search for identity, leaving him both under suspicion and overdressed.||\\nHolidays on Ice || David Sedaris’s beloved holiday collection is new again with six more pieces, including a never before published story. Along with such favoritesas the diaries of a Macy’s elf and the annals of two very competitive families, are Sedaris’s tales of tardy trick-or-treaters (“Us and Them”); the difficulties of explaining the Easter Bunny to the French (“Jesus Shaves”); what to do when you’ve been locked out in a snowstorm (“Let It Snow”); the puzzling Christmas traditions of other nations (“Six to Eight Black Men”); what Halloween at the medical examiner’s looks like (“The Monster Mash”); and a barnyard secret Santa scheme gone awry (“Cow and Turkey”). No matter what your favorite holiday, you won’t want to miss celebrating it with the author who has been called “one of the funniest writers alive” (Economist).||\\nCalypso || David Sedaris returns with his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious book. If you’ve ever laughed your way through David Sedaris’s cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you’re getting with Calypso. You’d be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it’s impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny–it’s a book that can make you laugh ’til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris’s powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future. This is beach reading for people who detest beaches, required||\\nDavid Sedaris: Live For Your Listening Pleasure || If you were lucky enough to have caught a performance on David Sedaris’s most recent sold-out, 34-city tour, you already know that David Sedaris Live For Your Listening Pleasure is a must-have album! If you didn’t hear it live and in person, then you’re in for a treat-hilarious brand-new recordings from performances in Denver, New York, Durham, LA, and Atlanta, in one convenient audiobook collection, on sale November 24 for only $17.98. From the bold feral rabbits of his French backyard to the eating habits of a carnivorous bird Down Under, Live For Your Listening Pleasure takes listeners on a veritable tour of natural wonders, beginning with a fable, “Cat and Baboon,” and moving on to the peculiarly American habitat of the “big-box” store. “Sedaris’s sparkling essays always shimmer more brightly when read aloud by the author. And his expert timing, mimicry and droll asides are never more polished than during live performances in front of an audience.” Publishers Weekly, Starred Review – When You Are Engulfed in Flames Track Listing: 1: Cat and Baboon (Temple Hoyne Buell Theatre in Denver, Colorado) 2-5: Author, Author (Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City) 6-8:||\\n'],\n",

But surely the truth—that I had never hated anyone the way I hated him—would have destroyed our friendship. If I had been honest—if I had sacrificed our love for theirs—then Charles would almost certainly still be alive.”—the exact moment that I knew Seven Lies would be a twisty and thrilling treat of a tale. Jane’s long-time best friend, Marnie, is also her roommate until Jane falls hard for Jonathan. Jane moves in with Jonathan and on with her life. But when Jonathan dies in an accident, Jane tries to rekindle her relationship with Marnie to tragic effect. If you like your thrillers twisty and unexpected, Seven Lies is a must-read. Its characters are complex. Plus, watching all the plot threads coalesce into the surprising conclusion was great fun. 4.5 stars!

But in the No Gluten, No Problem Pizza cookbook, the authors provide a plethora of pizza options including Chicago Deep Dish and New York-style pizzas. Variety is no problem. For you thin crust fans, there are four variations on roman cracker dough and four more on tavern dough, which is less crunchy but still thin. There are grilled, filled, flatbread, focaccia, breakfast, buckwheat, cauliflower, zucchini, dessert, and California-style pizzas too. For several of the doughs, there is a long (50-hour) rise version and a fast one too. All the recipes have full-color photographs. There is no nutritional information but if you are eating pizza you probably don’t want it anyway. The recipes sound and look delicious. The authors took many of the recipes directly home from Italy so you know they are authentic. My only issue with the book was the difficulty in sourcing the flours and other ingredients for the doughs. They weren’t in either of my two local markets. Surprisingly, they weren’t even available through Thrive Market. They did have them in Amazon—but they were pricey. However, as long as you make the||\\nIn this troubled time of curbside pickup, the Buzz Books 2020: Fall and Winter is an invaluable resource for finding new books and authors to read. When looking for a new book to read in a bookstore or library, everyone reads the blurb on the back or the front flap. If intrigued, most people will read the first chapter or two. This compendium of books offers the same ability, for free and in your own home—no face covering required. The books included here run the gamut of genres with literary fiction, mystery, science fiction, young adult, and non-fiction all included. I’m sure most readers will find a few books that fit their tastes. Publisher’s Lunch also has a Spring/Summer 2020 Book Buzz available for those impatient readers looking for a book now. They also publish a separate Book Buzz for romance fans. All three books are free for Kindle readers on Amazon. For book reviewers, there is a NetGalley link to request the book. At least one book is available to read now on Edelweiss+ too because I had already downloaded it before this Buzz Book was released. Overall, the Buzz Books 2020: Fall and Winter is a useful tool||\\n“Socialite and husband dead in suicide pact. Teenage children missing; baby found alive.” The Family Upstairs is the story of that baby’s journey to discover her roots and what really happened that night. The baby, Libby, is now twenty-five years old and set to inherit the Chelsea mansion where the event occurred. Lucy is a homeless English woman with two children in France. Henry is a rich, but odd, man who is one of the missing teenagers twenty-five years later. “It all happened so slowly, yet so extraordinarily quickly, the change to our parents, to our home, to our lives after they arrived.” All three tell their tales of what happened both before and after the event. The Family Upstairs is a compelling thriller that builds an impressive atmosphere of dread. Everyone but the people involved know something horrible is going to happen. It is truly a can’t-put-it-down book. The characters are so human and realistic that you are forced to read one more chapter until the story is done regardless of what time your alarm will ring. I love the author’s books for their originality in a crowded genre. But most of all, I love that she thanked the||\\nBrewed Awakening (A Coffeehouse Mystery) by Cleo Coyle My Review I have read almost all of the Coffeehouse Mysteries. Brewed Awakening is my favorite so far. Using an innovative plot device like amnesia refreshes the series because Claire is thrust back to the beginning. She only remembers what happened ten years ago when she was recently divorced with an eleven-year-old daughter working in her ex-mother-in-law’s coffee shop. Imagine her surprise when the daughter is magically an adult and everyone, including herself, looks older than she remembers. She doesn’t even recognize the love of her life, Mike, who recently asked for her hand in marriage. Claire is on camera as a witness to an heiress’ abduction. The shock has made her lose her recent memories. Can a miracle doctor help her memories return? Brewed Awakening combines the best of a cozy mystery’s character focus with a thriller’s pace and plotline. It results in an innovative story that elevates what is achievable within the cozy mystery genre. It is highly recommended! 5 stars!

Oz Clarke\\'s fat tome on the area and its wines (and, per the subtitle, the vineyards and winemakers) is a decent pick, but it\\'s not the best I\\'ve seen. As is frequently the problem with \\\\\"celebrity\\\\\" authors, the book is significantly more concerned with Oz Clarke than with Bordeaux. The word \\\\\"I\\\\\" appears on nearly every page. And Clarke himself is seen mugging in a vast number of pictures (far more than any winemakers, anyway). Wine is a subjective experience, but encyclopedias are not, in my estimation, best presented as such. When Clarke first consumed some Chateau\\'s wine or another doesn\\'t provide a lot useful information for the reader, and instead it makes the book often feel like it\\'s dragging on, just filling pages, when it should be getting to the point. The real gems of Bordeaux (this version was updated in 2012) can be found in the sidebars and back-of-chapter descriptions of various chateaus, although these are tragically too short.

Half-hearted attempts have been made to hold peace talks between the warring sides from Andhra Pradesh in 2004 to Bengal in 2011 but have ended in killing of key Maoist leaders. As the blame game continues, civil society remains bitterly divided on which side has failed peace.This collection of essays, by well-known activists and academics including the mediators, examines the failed peace initiatives in the context of the governments’ elitist ‘developmental’ policies, doublespeak of the parliamentary parties and Maoists’ follies. Dissecting the paradigms of peace, role of civil society and peace mediators, they offer wide range of views on Maoist violence vis-à-vis State violence while reflecting on the debates about democracy under red power and autonomy of grassroots movements and organisations.Students and teachers of contemporary South Asian history, studies in development and conflicts, policy researchers, activists, journalists and other discerning readers will find this book particularly helpful.||\\n\"],\n",

Three years in the making, it is the first book of its kind, and may eventually define the more than 20 year Kryon lineage. DNA is our chemical blueprint, but the Human Genome Project found that over ninety percent of it is not coded. In fact, only approximately four percent creates the 23,000 genes in the Human body. The rest? It’s a puzzle to the extreme, and to this day there is no answer why most of DNA seems to have no symmetry or codes of any kind. In fact, it seems to be random. Kryon has now given us full channelled explanation of this, and brings it right into the quantum world. Is it possible that DNA is mostly quantum instructions? And if so, what’s in those instructions that comprise over 2.7 billion chemicals per strand? Here is a full revelation of the twelve layers, or energies of DNA, complete with full color channelled illustrations of each layer by Israeli/American artist Elan Dubro-Cohen. Could it be that our entire Akashic record is carried in our DNA? What else might be represented? It starts to make sense, and the||\\nNavigating The Splitting Prism Transformation and Earth || Now that many parallel realities are beginning to overlap on our planet, it's becoming easier to see people choosing many different paths that will lead to many different versions of Earth. In this session Bashar gives us a new tool that will help us deal with the changes we're observing. We can learn better discernment, how to tell what our choices are. This new permission slip will show us how to maintain the state of being that we most prefer regardless of how the circumstances may appear. That preferred state of being can become the navigational device that allows us to find ourselves in the parallel reality that best suits who we truly are.

The dynamic synthesis of moving light projected upon this geometric artwork generates a complex visual field that allows you to perceive in multiple dimensions. The Holotope was developed as a way of communing with the unifying structures of the Universe. A deeper sense of peace, clarity and creativity can be resourced. The Holotope Mandala – An Exquisite Journey! Using pioneering technology that integrates the beauty of light, sound, and geometry, Randall Fontes and Kirby Seid assist groups and individuals into transcendent spiritual states. “The underlying unity of these primal forces can be realized through direct experience,” explains Fontes. “When light patterns activate this moving geometric mandala, it begins unfolding like a lotus in front of you and within you. As you witness the mind trying to capture the mystery, awareness touches the innermost self and spontaneous meditation arises.” The Holotope Mandala The Holotope Mandala, which spans 8-feet across, is a stunning geometric expression based on the E8 polytope. Physicists consider polytopes to be the most beautiful shapes in mathematics. The Holotope Mandala is a skewed projection of eight dimensional layers||\\n\"],\n",

The fight sequence will fill your body with adrenaline. Chris had taken immense effort in writing this sequel. Because it is far good than its prequel. Hats off Chris. He is standing a step high while explaining a fight. So I recommend all teens get Shane on this book. Synopsis Japan 1612. One year of training in samurai school and Jack is in real trouble… He’s busy preparing for the Circle of Three, an ancient ritual that tests courage, skill and spirit to the limit. And at the same time Jack is caught in a running battle with fellow student Kazuki and his gang. But these are the least of Jack’s problems. He knows his deadly rival – the ninja Dragon Eye – could strike at any moment. Jack possesses the very thing he will kill for. Can Jack master the way of the Sword in time to survive a fight to the death? Review The first book in Chris Bradford’s Young Samurai series, The Way of the Warrior, received the 2007 Sasakawa Foundation Award for the best book interpreting Japan to the English-speaking world and also won Book of the Year at the Fighting Spirit Awards in 2008. So all the author had to in the second book, The Way of the Sword, was to give us exactly the same again… except better! And he has managed to do this all rather well.

Tolkien is the authoritative collection of facts about the man behind Middle-earth, and his remarkably detailed imaginative world of Hobbits and Elves. Though undoubtedly an academic, there was much more to J.R.R. Tolkien. He was ‘kidnapped’ as a baby in South Africa, orphaned, and mentally scarred from the bloody Battle of the Somme of World War I. His major book, The Lord of the Rings, one of the most popular and successful stories of our time, was expected by its doubting publisher to make a big loss. From ordinary places that inspired Tolkien, to imaginary creatures or settings, or from his world of scholarship to the faith that sustained him, wherever you go, you will be certain to find clues and insights that explore all aspects of the incredible Tolkien phenomenon. What is the connection between J.R.R. Tolkien and Bletchley Park? Did J.R.R. Tolkien predict the great storm of 1987? To which character in The Lord of the Rings did Tolkien compare himself? Does Sam Gamgee really bribe Gollum with fish and chips? How did C.S. Lewis write J.R.R. Tolkien’s obituary from beyond the grave? Find the answers to these and many other intriguing aspects||\\n1 || 10 || Between Two Thorns by Emma Newman is an offbeat urban fantasy published by Angry Robot Books. This is the first book in The Split Worlds trilogy (maybe series?), and all three books were published in 2013. Despite the rapid rate of publication, it is clear that these books have not been rushed, that a lot of time and effort has been put in, and I look forward to reading this series in its entirety. Between Two Thorns does a lot of work upfront establishing a very complex setting. There are basically three realms - Mundanus which is our world where the humans (or mundanes) live, Exilium which is a fantastical world where the powerful fae live, and The Nether, a bubble of a world that exists in between Mundanus and Exilium, a world where the fae-touched people live, a world that seems to be a perpetual Victorian court society. Newman goes to a lot of effort with regards to the world building early in this book, and while I think it makes for a better story in the long run, I found that it took nearly 100 pages before I was really hooked by this story. I know it's probably||\\n1 || 10 || Eona was awesome dude. I have recently had an uncanny good run of books to read and review. One of those books included Eon by Alison Goodman, and so it was natural that Eona would be on that same pile of books for me to read and enjoy. Instead of anything cataclysmic happening in my life to make up for the supremely well written books I was reading, life just sent me a sour lemon of a book instead. Eona. You have to wonder how someone can stuff up a sequel. If you’ve got a winning strategy in your first book, why go and undo it in the second? That’s a question I was asking myself a lot while reading Eona, and one I still can’t answer for you. Eona left me unsatisfied and frustrated, something that a book should never do, in my humble opinion. Before picking apart the bad stuff, I want to just say that Alison Goodman obviously as a career ahead of her. She has the ability to write really well, the depth of detail and ability to not overwhelm the reader with that same depth of detail is a fine art that I think Goodman has mastered, and her It was a great book so don't bash it just because you don't like dose't mean others din't if you did not like it don't read it!||\\n1 || 10 || Give me a world where dragons and magic are real but everything else is historically accurate with France of the mid-17th century, and I’ll be hooked on the premise alone. Combine that with fascinating characters and a story that really does keep you turning the pages well into the early hours of the morning, and you’ll leave me a happy man. That’s exactly what Pierre Pevel does with his latest book, ‘The Alchemist in the Shadows’, the sequel to ‘The Cardinals Blades’ and a worthy successor at that. The story continues on less than a month from the end of the first book, and doesn’t lose any of its pacing or excitement in the process. A new enemy is being unmasked, and La Fargue and his Blades are soon on the hunt for one of France’s worst enemies, not to mention their own. Pevel has a real sense of what Paris and France would have been like back in the 17th century. It makes the story all the more real and believable, and allows the fantastical elements of dragons and magic to sit believably in the centre of the story.

The year is 1805, and war is brewing in Western Europe, as Napoleon conquers countries one after the other. The fear among the aristocracy is growing, and the interplay among the noble families is as much a theme of the novel as the historical setting of the war.||\\n4 || This book is a novel that can appeal to both children as well as adults.

As his adventures continue Lemuel sees the tables turn when his travels lead him to a world of giants twelve times his size. Next he finds himself in the clouds, in a society of scholars.

They fight to advance or simply to survive; they fight against odds, against enemies, even against themselves. In this, his first collection of stories, the acclaimed novelist introduces readers to a vivid and eclectic cast of combatants. A seasoned claims investigator tracks a supposedly dead man from Miami to Brazil, only to be thrown off his game by a kid from the local slum. An aging loser takes a last stab at respectability by becoming a police informant.

Private Investigator Derek Strange and his partner, Terry Quinn, are running a detective business in the seedy underbelly of Washington, DC when they are approached by a young man asking them to find his girlfriend who has gone missing. And so Strange and Quinn find her. Just another day? Not quite. In the grimy underworld inhabited by Strange, nothing is that simple. For Strange and Quinn’s efforts have led to a young mother being brutally murdered — a devastating discovery that causes them both to question the morality by which they live. And yet at the same time they need to continue the search for another missing girl, a teenage runaway who shows up in a porn video. And who hasn’t been seen since. Step by step, Strange and his partner are drawn into the darkness, confronting gunrunners, crime lords, drug dealers, and ordinary people caught up in the ruthless violence of the business. Soul Circus is a heart-stopping thriller that could only have been written by George Pelecanos, the writer who “has gone from cult favorite to acknowledged||\\n2013-10-08 || Every man has his dark side . . . Spero Lucas confronts his own in the most explosive thriller yet from one of America’s best-loved crime writers. The job seems simple enough: retrieve the valuable painting — “The Double” — Grace Kinkaid’s ex-boyfriend stole from her. It’s the sort of thing Spero Lucas specializes in: finding what’s missing, and doing it quietly. But Grace wants more. She wants Lucas to find the man who humiliated her — a violent career criminal with a small gang of brutal thugs at his beck and call. Lucas is a man who knows how to get what he wants, whether it’s a thief on the run — or a married woman. In the midst of a steamy, passionate love affair that he knows can’t last, in pursuit of a dangerous man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, Lucas is forced to decide what kind of man he is — and how far he’ll go to get what he wants.||\\n'],\n",

Are you with me?” Effective Engineering Solutions has been inexplicably shut down and the head of the company, Eli Glinn, has all but vanished. Fresh off a diagnosis that gives him only months to live, Gideon Crew is contacted by one of his coworkers at EES, Manuel Garza, who tells him the two have mere hours to collect their belongings before the office closes forever. After years of dedicated service and several high-risk missions, theirs seems like the most ignoble of terminations-until Gideon and Garza happen upon an incredible discovery. After centuries of silence, a code-breaking machine at EES has cracked the long-awaited translation of a centuries-old stone tablet, the Phaistos Disc, that dates back to an otherwise completely unknown, ancient civilization. The mysteries of the message itself hint at incredible treasures, and perhaps even a world-altering secret. No one remains at EES to take on this most remarkable mission but||\\n2008-05-19 || The Coxeman finds himself in a new position as a leader of a team of young men and women from his League for Sexual Dynamics whose mission is to discover how and why masses of enemy agents are infiltrating America.

One of his team must be a double agent. But who? And how can Rod uncover the traitor before America is overrun by spies? Rod lays his plans accordingly-and discovers that rescuing victory from the jaws of defeat all depends on how you snatch it!||\\n2008-12-14 || In this heartfelt testament to the power of love and the strength of the human spirit, Travis Roy, who suffered a devastating injury eleven seconds into his first college hockey game, reveals how he has managed to cope after the accident and, with the help of family and friends, overcome tremendous barriers to begin a new life.||\\n2020-09-29 || Brian Billick, Super Bowl-winning coach and current analyst for the NFL network, takes on the 2018 draft class of quarterbacks and follows them for two years, identifying the tangibles and intangibles of success, in search of the key to better predicting who will make it as a top-ranked NFL franchise QB. There are elite athletes in every sport — people who possess tangible and intangible qualities that allow them to overcome daunting odds, spot opportunity in the midst of adversity, and turn defeat into victory. No position embodies this dynamic more than football quarterbacks, and nothing is a greater test of performance than the NFL. The tangibles — metrics, stats, ratings, bowl games, championships — are critical to evaluation. But they’re not enough. Every year, highly rated college quarterbacks are analyzed, critiqued, hyped up and/or doubted, and those who manage to survive the scrutiny are drafted early. Some of those early picks make it to the top, some end up journeymen, and some just wash out. Why? What separates the elites from the pack? In THE Q FACTOR, former NFL coach Brian Billick takes the highly promising 2018 NFL quarterback Draft class — the most touted class since 2004 (Manning,||\\n1999-12-01 || Experience the unforgettable, heartbreaking love story set in post-World War II North Carolina about a young socialite and the boy who once stole her heart — one of PBS’s “Great American Reads”.

SCHINDLER’S ARK, THE BOOK BEHIND OSCAR-WINNING FILM “SCHINDLER’S LIST”: In the shadow of Auschwitz, a flamboyant German industrialist grew into a living legend to the Jews of Cracow. He was a womaniser, a heavy-drinker and a bon viveur, but to them he became a saviour. This is the extraordinary story of Oskar Schindler, who risked his life to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland and who was transformed by the war into a man with a mission, a compassionate angel of mercy. SEARCHING FOR SCHINDLER, THE TRUE STORY BEHIND SCHINDLER’S ARK: In 1980 Thomas Keneally walked into a shop in Beverley Hills to buy a briefcase, an impulse that was to change his life. For the owner, Leopold Pfefferberg, had a story he’d been trying to interest writers and Hollywood in for years. It was the story of Oskar Schindler. A FAMILY MADNESS: Inspired by a true incident, this powerful and disturbing novel focuses on Rudi Kabbel, a survivor of Nazi-occupied Belorussia, and Terry Delaney, a young Australian rugby player who falls in love with Kabbel’s daughter. With the optimism and innocence of those unscathed by war, Delaney||\\n2019-05-02 || ‘Alison Weir transforms Henry VIII’s much-maligned fourth wife into a woman of passion, courage and mystery’ Tracy Borman Alison Weir, historian and author of the Sunday Times bestsellers Katherine of Aragon: The True Queen, Anne Boleyn: A King’s Obsession and Jane Seymour: The Haunted Queen, paints a spellbinding portrait of Anna of Kleve, Henry VIII’s fourth queen. ‘This six-book series looks likely to become a landmark in historical fiction’ The Times A GERMAN PRINCESS WITH A GUILTY SECRET. The King is in love with Anna’s portrait, but she has none of the accomplishments he seeks in a new bride. She prays she will please Henry, for the balance of power in Europe rests on this marriage alliance. But Anna’s past is never far from her thoughts, and the rumours rife at court could be her downfall. Everyone knows the King won’t stand for a problem queen. ANNA OF KLEVE THE FOURTH OF HENRY’S QUEENS HER STORY Acclaimed, bestselling historian Alison Weir draws on new evidence to conjure a startling image of Anna as you’ve never seen her before. A charming, spirited woman, she was loved by all who knew her – and even, ultimately, by the King who rejected her.||\\n2020-09-03 || By the author of Schindler’s Ark and master storyteller, Thomas Keneally, a vibrant novel about Charles Dickens’ son and his adventures in the Australian Outback. In 1868, Charles Dickens dispatches his youngest child to Australia. Like his brother Alfred before him, sixteen-year-old Edward is expected to learn to apply himself in what his father considers to be the new land of opportunity. Posted to a remote sheep station in New South Wales, Edward discovers that Charles Dickens’ fame has reached even there, as has the gossip about his father’s scandalous liaison with an actress. Amid colonists, ex-convicts, local tribespeople and a handful of eligible young women, Edward strives to be his own man – and keep secret the fact that he’s read none of his father’s novels. Conjuring up a life of sheep-droving, horse-racing and cricket tournaments in a community riven with tensions and prejudice, the story of Edward’s adventures also affords an intimate portrait of Dickens’ himself. This vivacious novel is classic Keneally: historical figures and events re-imagined with verve, humour and compassion.||\\n2020-08-11 || ‘The best novel I’ve encountered this year, brilliant and funny and profound, producing some of the most complex, fascinating characters I’ve ever known.

His whole life has been reduced to a preoccupation with the disappearance of Lara, a young waitress at his local café. Twenty-five years earlier, during the Cold War, a physicist Johannes Held had been sent by the East Germans to infiltrate a US military operation in the Arizona desert, where teleportation and other paranormal activities were being investigated. On his return to Germany he refused to divulge what he had learned there and Zeiger was summoned to obtain his confession. The torturer and the tortured strangely became friends. But Zeiger soon betrayed||\\n2020-09-10 || In 2017 Hodder published Frank White’s There Was A Time, surely the last novel about the Second World War to be written by someone who actually served in it. Now at the age of 93, Frank has written a poignant, nostalgic novella of coming of age in a Yorkshire village in the sixties and it is paired with another short novel set in Manchester at the outbreak of war and first published by Hodder in 1964. Innocence and A Morse Code Set are beautifully complementary in theme and show Frank White to be an author of extraordinary insight and tenderness.||\\n'],\n",

Catch the full video here, and share why you loved The Bear using #hooplabookclub! In an Edenic future, a girl and her father live close to the land in the shadow of a lone mountain. They possess a few remnants of civilization: some books, a pane of glass, a set of flint and steel, a comb. The father teaches the girl how to fish and hunt, the secrets of the seasons and the stars. He is preparing her for an adulthood in harmony with nature, for they are the last of humankind. But when the girl finds herself alone in an unknown landscape, it is a bear that will lead her back home through a vast wilderness that offers the greatest lessons of all, if she can only learn to listen. A cautionary tale of human fragility, of love and loss, The Bear is a stunning tribute to the beauty of nature\\'s dominion.||\\nThe Mountains Sing || EBook/Audiobook || Thank you to all who joined author Nguyễn Phan Quế Mai in June for hoopla Book Club LIVE! If you\\'d like to revisit our hour with this engaging author, head over to Instagram with @hoopladigital. With the epic sweep of Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko or Yaa Gyasi’s Homegoing and the lyrical beauty of Vaddey Ratner’s In the Shadow of the Banyan, The Mountains Sing tells an enveloping, multigenerational tale of the Trần family, set against the backdrop of the Việt Nam War. Trần Diệu Lan, who was born in 1920, was forced to flee her family farm with her six children during the Land Reform as the Communist government rose in the North. Years later in Hà Nội, her young granddaughter, Hương, comes of age as her parents and uncles head off down the Hồ Chí Minh Trail to fight in a conflict that tore not just her beloved country, but her family apart. Vivid, gripping, and steeped in the language and traditions of Việt Nam, The Mountains Sing brings to life the human costs of this conflict from the point of view of the Vietnamese people themselves, while showing us the true power of kindness and hope.

London, 1947: Besieged by the harshest winter in living memory, burdened by onerous shortages and rationing, the people of postwar Britain are enduring lives of quiet desperation despite their nation\\'s recent victory. Among them are Ann Hughes and Miriam Dassin, embroiderers at the famed Mayfair fashion house of Norman Hartnell. Together they forge an unlikely friendship, but their nascent hopes for a brighter future are tested when they are chosen for a once-in-a-lifetime honor: taking part in the creation of Princess Elizabeth\\'s wedding gown. Toronto, 2016: More than half a century later, Heather Mackenzie seeks to unravel the mystery of a set of embroidered flowers, a legacy from her late grandmother. How did her beloved Nan, a woman who never spoke of her old life in Britain, come to possess the priceless embroideries that so closely resemble the motifs on the stunning gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at her wedding almost seventy years before? And what was her Nan\\'s connection to the celebrated textile artist and holocaust||\\nThe Ungrateful Refugee || EBook/Audiobook || What Immigrants Never Tell You In her first work of nonfiction, Dina Nayeri defies stereotypes and raises surprising questions about the immigrant experience. Here are the real human stories of what it is like to journey across borders in the hope of starting afresh. What is it like to be a refugee? It is a question many of us do not give much thought to, and yet there are more than 25 million refugees in the world. Aged eight, Dina Nayeri fled Iran along with her mother and brother and lived in the crumbling shell of an Italian hotel turned refugee camp. Eventually she was granted asylum in America. She settled in Oklahoma, then made her way to Princeton University. In this book, Nayeri weaves together her own vivid story with the stories of other refugees and asylum seekers in recent years, bringing us inside their daily lives and taking us through the different stages of their journeys, from escape to asylum to resettlement.

Billie James\\'s inheritance isn\\'t much: a little money and a shack in the Mississippi Delta. The house once belonged to her father, a renowned black poet who died unexpectedly when Billie was four years old. Though Billie was there when the accident happened, she has no memory of that day—and she hasn\\'t been back to the South since. Thirty years later, Billie returns but her father\\'s home is unnervingly secluded: her only neighbors are the McGees, the family whose history has been entangled with hers since the days of slavery.

However, news from her home world of Sursamen would still reach her. Djan Seriy Anaplian is, after all, a member of Special Circumstances – a troubleshooter for the Culture, intervening when necessary to ensure that order and balance is maintained throughout the galaxy; and Special Circumstances get to hear about most things. The news itself, unfortunately, is not good. Her father has died. Her brother too, it seems. Both in the latest war against a neighbouring kingdom. Anaplian must journey home, but while she does so, another will seek her out. For someone on Sursamen believes her to be their last hope. What neither of them know is that she might also be the last hope for the entire world.||\\nInversions || The sixth Culture book from the awesome imagination of Iain M. Banks, a modern master of science fiction. In the winter palace, the King’s new physician has more enemies than she at first realises. But then she also has more remedies to hand than those who wish her ill can know about. In another palace across the mountains, in the service of the regicidal Protector General, the chief bodyguard, too, has his enemies. But his enemies strike more swiftly, and his means of combating them are more traditional. Spiralling round a central core of secrecy, deceit, love and betrayal, INVERSIONS is a spectacular work of science fiction, brilliantly told and wildly imaginative, from an author who has set genre fiction alight. Praise for the Culture series: ‘Epic in scope, ambitious in its ideas and absorbing in its execution’ Independent on Sunday ‘Banks has created one of the most enduring and endearing visions of the future’ Guardian ‘Jam-packed with extraordinary invention’ Scotsman ‘Compulsive reading’ Sunday Telegraph The Culture series: Consider Phlebas The Player of Games Use of Weapons The State of the Art Excession Inversions Look to Windward Matter Surface Detail The Hydrogen Sonata Other books by Iain M.

Armed gangs roam a lawless land where each farm and house supports a column of dark smoke. Taking to the roads with the other refugees, anonymous in their raggedness, seems safer than remaining in the ancient keep. However, the lieutenant of an outlaw band has other ideas and the castle becomes the focus for a dangerous game of desire, deceit and death. Iain Banks’ masterly novel reveals his unique ability to combine gripping narrative with a relentlessly voyaging imagination. The narrative technique and sheer brio of A SONG OF STONE reveal a great novelist at the height of his powers.||\\nThe Hydrogen Sonata || The Scavenger species are circling. It is, truly, the End Days for the Gzilt civilization. An ancient people, organized on military principles and yet almost perversely peaceful, the Gzilt helped set up the Culture ten thousand years earlier and were very nearly one of its founding societies, deciding not to join only at the last moment. Now they’ve made the collective decision to follow the well-trodden path of millions of other civilizations; they are going to Sublime, elevating themselves to a new and almost infinitely more rich and complex existence. Amid preparations though, the Regimental High Command is destroyed. Lieutenant Commander (reserve) Vyr Cossont appears to have been involved, and she is now wanted – dead, not alive. Aided only by an ancient, reconditioned android and a suspicious Culture avatar, Cossont must complete her last mission given to her by the High Command. She must find the oldest person in the Culture, a man over nine thousand years old, who might have some idea what really happened all that time ago. It seems that the final days of the Gzilt civilization are likely to prove its most perilous.||\\nThe Steep Approach To Garbadale || Dark family secrets and a long-lost love affair lie at the heart of Iain Banks’s fabulous new novel. The Wopuld family built its fortune on a board game called Empire! – now a hugely successful computer game. So successful, the American Spraint Corp wants to buy the firm out. Young renegade Alban, who has been evading the family clutches for years, is run to ground and persuded to attend the forthcoming family gathering – part birthday party, part Extraordinary General Meeting – convened by Win, Wopuld matriarch and most powerful member of the board, at Garbadale, the family’s highland castle. Being drawn back into the bosom of the clan brings a disconcerting confrontation with Alban’s past. What drove his mother to take her own life? And is he ready to see Sophie, his beautiful cousin and teenage love? Grandmother Win’s revelations wll radically alter Alban’s perspective for ever.||\\n'],\n",

As the Democrats swept into the White House on a wave of Black defectors from the Party of Lincoln, a group of African-American intellectuals - legal minds, social scientists, media folk - sought to get the community\\'s needs on the table. This would become the Black Cabinet, a group of African-American racial affairs experts working throughout the New Deal, forming an unofficial advisory council to lobby the President. But with the white Southern vote so important to the fortunes of the Party, the path would be far from smooth. Most prominent in the Black Cabinet were Mary McLeod Bethune, an educator close to Eleanor Roosevelt, and her \\\\\"boys\\\\\": Robert Weaver, a Harvard-educated economist who pioneered enforcement standards for federal anti-discrimination guidelines (and, years later, the first African-American Cabinet secretary); Bill Hastie, a lawyer who would become a federal appellate judge; Al Smith, head of the largest Black jobs program in the New Deal||\\n30 Old Books - September 2019 || 2019-09-25T08:33:16.000Z || Here is a collection of 30 old books published over a century ago!

With school over and the locked world of their fathers before them, they rush towards the climax of their youth: a magical weekend in Manchester, the epicentre of everything that inspires them in working-class Britain. There, against the greatest soundtrack ever recorded, a vow is made: to go at life differently. Thirty years on, half a life away, the phone rings. Tully has news.

Now, in the 21st century, things are different. Standing out is more of an achievement. This extensively illustrated survey presents the most significant photographers working today, with high-quality reproductions of their work alongside commentary and interviews. Their styles are varied: some are drawing on traditional styles while others are taking full advantage of modern techniques and technology. In each case, though, they have to deal with a post-Instagram world, where photography competes for mind space in a completely different way than it did at the turn of the century. This comprehensive and authoritative guide demonstrates why the work of the new masters is so significant, and gives a broad survey of the state of photography today. Artists featured include Nan Goldin, Wolfgang Tillmans, Hassan Hajjaj, Andreas Gursky, Juno Calypso, Ryan McGinley, Zanele Muholi, Shirin Neshat, Catherine Opie, Martin Parr, Cindy Sherman, Hiroshi Sugimoto and Juergen Teller.||\\n2018-07-12 || Master proportion, tone, texture and form with this inspirational sketchbook.

All but six of the original wood-blocks were destroyed during the Blitz, and those remaining were too fragile to be used in printing the present volume. Instead, reproductions were made from printed examples of Ravilious’ work held by his friends, colleagues, publishers, and in some cases, private and institutional collectors. For the few instances in which no extant copies of a known work could be located, the editors have listed the title, along with the apt caption ‘no copies found’. Eric Ravilious was born in Acton in 1903. Upon the failure of his father’s furniture business, the family relocated to Eastbourne. Ravilious spent his youth on the Channel Coast, where he would return throughout his life to paint the Sussex landscape. He studied at the Eastbourne Art School, and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in 1922, where he studied under Paul Nash. Enrolling in the design school, he met fellow pupils Edward Bawden and Douglas Percy Bliss, with whom he would remain life-long friends. Ravilious was awarded a travelling scholarship towards the end of his time at the Royal College, and went to Italy.||\\n2400.0 || ||\\n200.0 || ||\\n75.0 || ||\\n850.0 || ||\\n'],\n",

Jill’s novels are loved by reviewers: ‘Achingly romantic’ Heat Jessie has kept the identity of her son Oliver’s father a secret for years. She’s stunned when she discovers that the man in question, actor Toby Gillespie, has just moved in next door. The truth’s about to come out. One glance at Oliver, and a little mental arithmetic, and Toby has the situation sussed. Meeting the son he never knew he had is the shock of a lifetime. It’s a shock, too, for Toby’s wife, the beautiful Deborah, though she seems to take it in her stride. Would Deborah be so relaxed if she knew just how close Toby wants to get to the mother of his firstborn? As the attraction between them flares up again, Jessie just can’t see her way to a happy ending.

Thankfully she’s blossomed since then. But when she meets Kerr McKinnon one starry summer’s night and discovers, days later, who he actually is… well, that’s when the problems really start. Because everyone in Ashcombe knows what happened eleven years ago, and as far as her mother’s concerned, Marcella would rather tear that family to pieces with her bare hands than see Maddy associate with a McKinnon. It’s Romeo and Juliet all over again. Quick, hide those sharp knives and that little bottle of poison… What readers are saying about Falling For You: ‘Completely unputdownable.

But he’s not Tyler – and he’s not even at all what he seems.

Drawing on several years of talking through these issues with people looking for answers, Nicky Gumbel offers clear, accessible and reasoned responses to the questions that surround faith and Christianity in the modern world. He goes beyond the logic of each question and applies it to a wider understanding of God’s identity and our own identity, with practical suggestions for dealing with these issues in everyday life. ‘Gumbel’s combination of humour, anecdote, metaphysics, quotations from the Bible and complex theology are both persuasive and compelling.’ – The Observer||\\n2019-04-18 || ||\\n2020-08-06 || Attractive, imitation-leather-bound journalling Bible with high quality paper and extra wide ruled margins for note taking and referencing.

Tolkien, begun in 1916, when he was twenty-five years old, and left incomplete several years later. It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for the Lost Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend and association, they are set in the narrative frame of the great westward voyage of a mariner named Eriel (or AElfwine). His destination is Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle where Elves dwell; from them he learns their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. The Tales include the earliest accounts of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmography of their invented world. The Book of Lost Tales is published in two volumes.

Mr. Richards, the father of one of Fred’s tennis players, is expressing his unhappiness loudly and profanely. When Jocelyn arrives the next day to find Fred dead in the tennis shed, the sleuthing instincts she developed in another brush with murder (Death on Tour, 2011) take over. On the case is handsome Austin Police Detective Colin Gallagher, who Jocelyn’s look-alike cousin Kyla insists has taken a shine to Jocelyn. The strain on Jocelyn’s long-distance relationship with Dallas travel agent Alan Stratton, who’s never delivered on his promise to move to Austin, makes her receptive to Gallagher’s overtures. But she’s furious when the discovery of marijuana in the tennis shed leads Gallagher to suspect Fred of dealing. Jocelyn’s appointment as temporary tennis coach earns her the enmity of Mr. Richards and another teacher who wanted the job. And her snooping pits her against the drama teacher and the woman who handles all the money for school activities. Soon enough, Jocelyn is attacked in a nearby park while her tennis team act as extras in a movie, and her best friend on the teaching||\\nMirabelle and Meg Moffat have grown up traveling with their circus-acrobat parents. While the twins resemble each other, with elongated, oval heads; rosy cheeks; and large, expressive black dots for eyes, their personalities are nothing alike. From a young age, Mirabelle, always dressed in blue, has liked action, much to her parents’ delight. Meg, always dressed in yellow, has preferred talking—and staying on the ground. When their parents decide it’s time they join the family business, Mirabelle takes to acrobatics with ease. Deemed “fearless,” she becomes the headliner for the next show. But as Meg takes her turn on the trapeze platform, she becomes speechless for the first time, and her parents realize that she is afraid of heights. On the day of Mirabelle’s grand debut, action verbs describe her amazing feats and the crowd’s response. But when the press demands interviews afterward, she finds herself speechless and afraid. Meg finally recognizes her own fearless talent, becoming the spokesperson and announcer for the circus. While the finale highlights individualism, wise caregivers will also note the common pitfall of expecting children to follow in their footsteps. The twins’ yellows and blues set against the reds of the circus tent give the||\\nMcGuire (What Goes Around Comes Around, 1995, etc.) sweeps out his graphic arts playhouse for a scrapbook of conundrums, collages, and shadow plays. Swiping a historical reference to Peter Newell's The Hole Book, the opening pages have holes that become--in the turn of the page--peepholes, heads, noses, and a baby's open mouth. McGuire then switches over to shadow play, displaying the shadow of an elephant in one case, a dinosaur in another, neither of which is what it seems to be. He throws in a few topsy-turvy puzzle faces, and then switches to construction paper collages, surreal landscapes where a lobster smokes a pipe, an eyeball adorns a flowering apple tree, and a squirrel on a branch sprouts antlers. Another hole leads the book to its finish, an upside-down mirror-image of the title page. The illustrations are dandy, with compositions that must be pored over even though they never intertwine with the text; this is a collection of intriguing pictures rather than story carried and complemented by images.||\\n\"],\n",
