In addition to my own concerns, my aunts were not open to the idea of having a \\\\\"stranger\\\\\" in their home initially, despite desperately needing assistance at home with daily living. From the moment I met Sheri Kennedy, she put my concerns at ease. Not only was she extremely professional, she is warm and compassionate. It’s clear she enjoys what she does and genuinely cares about her clients. Sheri approaches her work with what seems like an effortless abundance of enthusiasm. She met with my family several times to determine my aunts’ specific needs and address all of my concerns. She also met with my aunts to get to know them to determine who among Amada\\'s team of caregivers would be the right fit. This made all the difference. Overall, I had an extremely positive experience with Amada Senior Care and would highly recommend them to anyone seeking in-home care for a friend or loved one. || ||\\n || https://www.amadaseniorcare.com/tulsa-senior-care ||  ||  ||  ||  || I contacted Amada and visited with Tonnie Wainscott. My husband needed non-emergency transport to St. John\\'s Hospital for a blood transfusion. All the arrangements were made for him promptly and professionally. Kem came to pick up Bob right on time. He was very friendly, well dressed and put us both at ease. He not only got Bob to St. John\\'s, he got him a wheelchair and took him up to the infusion floor himself. He stayed with him until they called his name. Bob had never had an infusion before, so he appreciated this greatly. Bob called me to let me know he was ready for pickup later on, only to stop in the middle of our conversation to let me know that Kem was standing right there to escort him out of the hospital! He had apparently spoken with staff to get an approximate completion time, and was right there to ensure Bob didn\\'t have to wait to come home. We can\\'t say enough wonderful things about Amada, and will definitely use them again if necessary. We would recommend them without hesitation. || ||\\n || https://www.amadaseniorcare.com/phoenix-senior-care ||  ||  ||  ||  || I didnt know why I should continue paying for my long term care policy after my husband passed away in April. It seemed very expensive and I didn’t notice any benefit during my husband’s illness. The length of time he was ill was so short that the benefits didn’t kick in. Kimberly came and explained the quality (Cadillac) of my policy and why I should continue to pay for it. After she finished explaining I couldn’t wait to pay the premium! Now, that’s amazing! || ||\\n || https://www.amadaseniorcare.com/pittsburgh-senior-care ||  ||  ||  ||  || Thank you so much for helping out my parents. I don\\'t know what I would have done without your expertise and experience working with their insurance company. We would have had know idea what to do or what say to the insurance company about using their policy to pay for care. Its such a relief to know they are in good hands. The care they are receiving has been excellent. I love the family portal that allows me to see how everything is going from afar. I\\'m so glad we found Amada Senior Care. || ||\\n || https://www.amadaseniorcare.com/wichita-senior-care ||  ||  ||  ||  || I don\\'t think I can say enough good things about Amada Senior Care. The personal care they provide my Mother is outstanding! Not only do they provide personal health care but the kindness and companionship that they have given to my Mom has made a world of difference for her. When we ran into serious issues with insurance (refusing to pay), Asa took this as a personal quest. After weeks of fighting with insurance, filing appeals and countless phone calls, we were ready to give up and discontinue the wonderful services due to all of the problems. But Asa would not give up and his perseverance paid off as today we were notified that all claims will be paid! Thank you Asa and thank you Amada for everything!

Sehr viel Freiheit bei der Aufstellung, anders als mein voriges Racksystem.Ich hatte zuerst das Basic Set im Januar 2018 bekommen und im Februar dann das Expansion Kit (zusätzliches Hänge Tom und 16\\\\\" Crash). Achtung Kick Pedal und HiHat Stand sind NICHT dabei, aber das wusste ich. Die Kabel für die Becken und Floortom habe ich mit silber Farbenen Klinkenkabeln von DrumTec verlängert. Einfach mit einem Klinken-Buchse auf Buchse (Stereo Version verwenden, sonst geht choke nicht) zusammen gesteckt. Das gibt mehr Freiraum bei der Aufstellung und sieht sehr schick aus an der Chrome Hardware. Die Becken lassen sich überall auf der Oberfläche bespielen, kein Hotspot bemerkbar. Auch abstoppen (choke) geht rundherum. Die Bell beim Ride ist sensitiver als beim Cy15r. Und 18\\\\\" macht was her. Die Shells spielen sich sehr natürlich und man fühlt sich wie an einem Musikinstrument, nicht an einem Instrumentsimulator, das ist aber sehr subjektiv, zugegeben. Gibts Kritik, na klar, aber nicht am Kit sondern an der Doku. Und hier speziell \\\\\"Wie ordne ich mein Set an\\\\\" zumindes als Startpunkt.

Dann gings los, ||  || ATV aDrums - artist series Basic Expanded without module ATV aDrums Side stick whenever you like We made it easier to play side stick. The side rim features a beautiful contrast between the natural wood and the lacquer paint, and uses the maple material that\\'s ideal for our newly developed frequency-specific detection technology. The strike feel of wood and the side stick sound are perfectly matched to ensure great playability. Rim shot and side stick can be played separately without having to use a side stick button to switch between them as on previous systems, giving you much more freedom in your performance. (PATENT PENDING) ATV aDrums Detect detailed pedalwork Within a drum performance, the hi-hat is being controlled with the greatest detail. Most previous electronic hi-hats used contact-type sensors, which had limited detection precision and tracking ability. The hi-hat of the aDrums uses a non-contact sensor that allows high-precision sensing with no delay even when the pedal is opened and closed rapidly. The hi-hat control algorithm of the aD5 has been optimized for this new sensor, delivering even greater expressive power and accuracy.

Das Triggering ist genauso gut wie bei den Roland Becken. Ich finde sogar die Bell besser. Außerdem spielt es sich automatisch besser, da 18\\\\\" einfach ein authentischeres Spielgefühl mit sich bringt. Abdrücke, wie man sie auf manchen Videos oder Fotos sieht, gibt es auf meinem Becken keine. Ich verwende Standard Vic Firth Sticks und habe nach über einem Monat keinen einzigen Abdruck am Becken. Bin total zufrieden! Hallo an alle E-Dummer Habe das Becken an meinem TD20 angeschlossen und war echt überrascht das es richtig gut funktioniert Alles reagiert so wie ich es erwartet hatte Die 360° spielfreiheit ist echt klasse Ich danke ATV dafür das sie ein 18\\\\\" Becken gemacht haben das auch an modulen angeschlossen werden kann die eben kein usb digital haben Ich bin eigentlich ein Roland fan aber das sie einen zwingen wollen ein td30 oder 50 kaufen zu müssen um in den genuss eines 18\\\\\" Becken zu spielen ist echt gemein Und nicht verbraucher freundlich Ich hoffe nur das Roland endlich kongurenz bekommt ATV ist echt eine sehr gute alternative zu Roland ich bin begeistert Und danke an drum-tec für die schnelle lieferung Ach ja noch etwas ich gebe nur desshalb 9 Punkte weil ich immernoch der meinung bin das für den Preis den man bezahlt wenigstens kabel und befestigungsschraube dabei sein könnten Es triggert fantastisch (hab\\'s an einem Pearl Mimic Pro), sieht extreeem schick aus und hat die richtige Grösse. Bin total happy damit. Es ist wirklich sehr traurig das man schon 499€ bezahlt und es kommt nur das Becken ohne Befestigungsschraube und Kabel na ja am Wochenende werde ich das Becken an meinem TD20 EX Testen nach dem ich das 18\\\\\" Cymbal nun ausgiebig gespielt habe, kann ich nur sagen das sich meine Erwartungen absolut erfüllt haben. Ich spiele es als Ride in meinem DIY Kit und liebe es! Durch die Größe spielt es nicht authentisch und ich habe auch keine Abdrücke auf dem Becken wie man sie in manchen, vor allem englischsprachigen Reviews, findet. Das einzige was mit aufgefallen ist, ist das ich um die Edge sauber anspielen zu können, das Becken recht gerade aufhängen muss. Das mache ich mit meinem Ride aber eh immer daher ist das kein großes Manko für mich. Eventuell liegt das auch an meinen Einstellungen (Roland TD9) und ich muss das noch weiter dran rumfummeln. :D. Das Geld ist dieses Ding auf jeden Fall wert wenn man auf Authentizität Wert legt und nicht gleich 5000 Euro ausgeben will für ein Roland TD-50.

As a Young Life leader I work with middle and high school students every day and am always hoping to learn more about how to better love and understand them and how to encourage parents to do the same. Drew Hill hits the nail on the head here! PEOPLE. This book is the bomb! I&#039;ve felt for years that my calling is with the Middle School/High School teens, the outcasts and misfits and those who are just playing the background in a loud, upbeat world. I&#039;ve worked with teenagers one on one as a teenager myself and now at 20, I still feel that same passion and love when I&#039;m working with them. But sometimes I feel so out of the loop with them. I don&#039;t always feel qualified. They talk about their phones like they&#039;re their best friends. There&#039;s drama with guys and not getting enough loves on musicly. Sometimes I don&#039;t understand their lingo. Sometimes I just struggle to feel I&#039;m actually making a difference. Drew Hill made my week though -- this book was like water. He speaks with frank, refreshing honesty through real life stories. He lets people like me know that you are okay, that God doesn&#039;t call the qualified. He encourages us to be a friend to the friendless, to see God working in the little things, and shows us from real life examples how God has worked in his life and the life of his teen friends. I easily put this In Drew Hill’s new book, Alongside, produced by New Growth Press, he demonstrates how to minister to teenagers in a way which is intuitive, as well as providing tangible results. As a minister to youth myself, this ministry is also known as incarnational ministry, and it is integral in ministering to youth. Alongside, provides four stages of ministering to youth and how to go about putting this form of ministry into action. Each of the twenty-nine chapters provides different steps/actions to implement. While that seems like a great deal to read through, this work is just over 170 pages, keeping the chapters short and to the point while keeping the reader engaged. Furthermore each chapter ends with with two series of questions, one section is aimed at parents and the other is at youth ministers, each of these groups of questions are to help the reader implement the principles discussed. This is one of the most practical books on youth ministry on the market today and one the ones while you will keep coming back to again and again. Also on a side note, this book has one of the coolest cover designs, which bleed on the the pages I Great tool for wisdom in ministering to youth as a parent or in ministry. You are drawn in from the beginning! Great read for a team/parents to do together as well with the questions that are at the end of each chapter. Discussions are crucial and after reading each chapter, you’ll want to discuss it with others because it’s just that insightful and good! The teen years can be an exciting time of growth and new experiences. Yet, the teen years can also be filled with intimidation and loneliness. What is crucial during these teen years is for these young people to have older people, parents and youth leaders, come alongside them to mentor them. This is especially important with discipling youth in the church. Even with this need known, many youth leaders and parents feel ill-equipped to come alongside teenagers in a discipling relationship. In Alongside: Loving Teenagers with the Gospel, seasoned youth ministry leader Drew Hill seeks to change that. Over the course of four parts consisting of twenty-nine chapters, Pastor Hill writes to those who care about youth, helping them to better understand teenagers (part 1) while giving them biblical truths to know and practice (parts 2 and 3) for a sustaining and enduring ministry to teenagers (part 4). Chapters average about 6 pages in length and are structured to include sections pertaining to parents and those in ministry. The chapters close out with a Bible verse and pray on that particular theme or topic. In the appendix of the book, practical tools are listed for working with teenagers. More Practical || 19 || 5||\\nChamp Thornton has served the next generation extremely well with this thoughtful, engaging book. Radically Different is a thirteen-week Bible study centered on the idea of &quot;Good, Bad, New.&quot; That is, God made all things to be good, but because of human sin things are bad. But Jesus came to redeem the world and make all things new. The devotional hits just the right target for this age-group. With just three studies per week, it respects the hectic pace of life today while also stimulating growth in faithfulness. The artwork supplements the content without being either busy or childish. Parents and youth leaders will want to purchase the companion Teachers Guide as they study the material with their tweens and teens. This is a great resource that&#039;s worth your attention as you &quot;tell the next generation the glorious works of the Lord&quot; (Ps 78.4). You cannot overemphasize the importance of sight. Eve was tempted by what she saw; Job made a covenant to not set his eyes towards sinful things; the Psalmist begged God to open his eyes to see wondrous things from His law; and Paul says we are transformed by beholding God’s glory with unveiled face. What young people desperately need today is gospel-centered, spirit-empowered sight. This book will come alongside parents, youth groups, friends, and discipleship relationships to help young people do just that – see everything in their life through the lens of the gospel: good, bad, and new. If you are involved in any of the areas just mentioned, consider this book a beautiful and necessary companion. This 13 week program, written by Champ Thornton, is a guide for middle schoolers and young teens as they consider what it means to live as Christians in community and in their relationships. Helpfully, Thornton starts with the big picture. Week one starts with considering God and who he is. The next three weeks further explain the structure of the rest of the book, looking at creation, the fall and redemption (which he terms, the good, the bad and the new). The following 9 weeks look at different topic areas, all applying the lens of good, bad, new to each. These include their relationship with God under the headings of listening to God (in his word), talking to God (prayer), and worshipping God. Then, it turns to earthly relationships with parents, friends, family, and church as well as difficult and broken relationships. It is intended to be discussed as a group with a leader, but to have the youth prepare in advance. There are three short studies provided for the student each week (probably each 10 mins maximum), and there are also leader’s notes for further discussion and how to use the time spent together. As such, it would be Champ Thornton has written a great resource for Middle and High School students with a focus on the overarching story of the Scripture: Creation, Fall, and Redemption. After giving this Biblical-Theological foundation, he infuses it into the areas of life which all students experience. I will be using this with our own teenage children, as well as recommending it for the students of our local church. *Review copy provided by the publisher. Today’s youth want to know, “Who am I?” and “Why am I here?” Champ Thornton’s compelling resource invites youth to discover the all satisfying and fulfilling truth of the gospel. Bite sized lessons offer a feast of wisdom and relevant application. Radically Different will help you, at home and church, lead youth to know God, to know why they believe in him and how to talk to others about him. || 7 || 5||\\nI highly recommend &quot;A Better December&quot; for just about reader–Christian leaders, church members, and even folks who are not yet followers of Christ. As the book progresses, there is a narrative movement from Solomon to Jesus and the gospel is clearly and beautifully presented in an unique and disarming way. “What hath Proverbs to do with Christmas?” That was my initial question when I opened the pages of &quot;A Better December: Proverbs to Brighten Christmas&quot; by Steven Estes. The answer was surprising, “Quite a helpful lot!” In this little gift-sized book, Pastor Estes has taken the wisdom of Solomon in all of its brevity and sagacity and applied it directly to the blessings and perils of the holiday season. &quot;A Better December&quot; is easily my favorite book so far this year and the best book I’ve ever read about “doing Christmas” in faith. It’s More than a “Gift Book” &quot;A Better December&quot; is one of those short and squat “inspirational” hardbacks that people give to others at the holidays. But it’s not like any other gift book that I’ve ever seen. It is inspirational without being sentimental, warm and winsome without being sappy or fluffy. &quot;A Better December&quot; is full Don’t look now but December is right around the corner. This time of year can be as stressful and frantic as it is enjoyable and memorable. And as the pace of life quickens for everyone, the stress and panic seem to outweigh the peace and quiet. Steven Estes has offered us a short but poignant book to help us have &quot;A Better December.&quot; He looks to the Biblical wisdom expressed by Solomon in Proverbs as a cure for the holiday woes. In just over 80 brief pages, Estes provides an extended meditation on a Christian vision for this time of year. With poetic verse (at times), and personal stories, Estes crafts a masterful tale that is disarming, fresh and inspiring. Each of the brief chapters reads like an essay or reflection and the takeaways are direct yet unscripted. The book is short, gift-sized, you could say. It would adorn a coffee table if larger. The simple yet alluring sketches from illustrator Sarah Bland Halulko make this small book a joy to look at and page through. It is the perfect gift book for the non-reader and reader alike. It points the interested to a few additional resources at the end, Steven Estes captures the full gambit of feelings that accompany the Christmas season in A Better December: Proverbs to Brighten Christmas. Sage counsel from King Solomon&#039;s writing. Over the years I have experienced the same frustrations and the excitement of family Christmases Steven describes. I am grateful for a Christian heritage that shaped my values, attitudes and outlooks, especially as I face the Christmas season, with its commercialism, celebrations, traditions, and ceremonies. Steven Estes brings together a combination of comfort, humor, and hope as he illustrates eternal truths through the inspired proverbs of Solomon, guiding the reader into the blessed truth of God&#039;s gift, His Son, our redeemer. In this pre-Christmas season I am facing new personal challenges. Reflecting on the heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking, stories included in A Better December has given me a new appreciation for the message of the season - the birth of Jesus, the promised savior. I know I&#039;m going to like a book when I read the introduction and smile, even chuckle a bit out loud when I&#039;m all by myself. And it gets better from there. Estes has authored a delightful little book that uses the Proverbs of Solomon to help us think about Christmas. Yes, that&#039;s right: Christmas. He writes about gifts, contentment, children and perfectionism. The Proverbs speak into longings, disappointments and changes. I&#039;m really quite taken by this short, well-illustrated book. It&#039;s probably one of those little coffee-table sized books, but it would make a great gift for Christmas. It&#039;s meditations can help prepare the heart to celebrate Jesus&#039; birth, with such thoughts regarding contentment. All the while, Estes is masterfully working to get us to see Jesus. Because this is not only what Christmas is all about, it&#039;s what Proverbs is ultimately all about. The Women&#039;s Readers Group at Cornerstone EFC is going to be reading this in late November/early December. I look forward to hearing from them their thoughts. I know this, I can highly commend this book to you. A BETTER DECEMBER is a unique approach to the holiday crazies. Who&#039;d ever think of applying the Book of Proverbs by King Solomon to Christmas? But Mr. Estes did and we will have A BETTER DECEMBER because of it. King Solomon touched on overspending--or staying within our budget, being a bit over-zealous in our greetings, contentment, surprises, childrens, disappointment and more. Full of poems, proverbs, and wisdom, this book is a great gift for an unbelieving friend or neighbor (gently pointing to the Savior) or for your own coffee table for visitors to thumb through. It might even brighten your own Christmas. || 14 || 5||\\nWhat struck me about this book was the depth of background. The loss focuses around a pet insect that showed illness, then passed away while pet owner Henry was at school. I was actually surprised that the bug died! The story didn’t end there, though. It continued to show how Henry dealt with the friend’s passing by withdrawing from his family and friends. It even showed him lashing out a bit. Finally, Henry’s father has a heart-to-heart with him about his own grief. It’s a touching story that kids will relate to. I especially liked that Henry prayed that he’d see the hurt in others. This was a wise-beyond-his-years prayer, and was a gentle way to show character growth and maturity. I received a copy of this book from the publisher. Opinions shared are mine. Henry Says Goodbye is fitting and faithful counsel for children when they feel sadness, particularly over the loss of someone or something. The animal characters in the story make the story fitting and engaging for the children the book is aimed to reach. The Back Pocket Bible Verse cut-outs move kids beyond the page to apply the truths learned from the story into their own life. Parents are also helped with a section in the back titled “Helping Your Child with Sadness”. Whether you are a parent, guardian, or youth leader, if you want to help younger elementary children learn how to handle sadness and loss in a way that deals with feelings and offers wise counsel, then make the move and buy Henry Says Goodbye. This is a beautifully illustrated book filled with critters and lovely scenes. The illustrations are perfect for the story told where Henry the Hedgehog (home is in a hedge) loses his pet ladybug. He is first sad and then angry at this loss of his beloved pet. His father consoles him and leads him in understanding loss and how &quot;God is close to those with a broken heart.&quot; A lovely story and will help children who have lost pets or loved ones understand. It will also help those who have not experienced loss understand help those who have. Henry is a little porcupine who has had to learn a very hard lesson. His pet ladybug has died. Loss, all loss, is hard for anyone, but I think especially for children who don&#039;t quite understand. His father really helps Henry through this, not by trite answers or shoving away the pain, but actually a productive way. By reminding us who we are and remembering who we have lost and thinking of others. The author does well with showing the early stages of grief. My son and I really felt for Henry and I think it is good for children to learn these lessons, if only through a book. Because unfortunately, life and death happens. I enjoy these Good News for Little Hearts a great deal. Their stories with lessons are always spot on and the illustrations fun and whimsical. I received a copy of this novel form the publisher. I was not required to post a positive review and all views and opinions are my own. Henry Says Good-bye is a heartfelt story that deals with the raw emotions of losing a pet ladybug written by Edward T. Welch. Like the other books in this series, this focuses on an animal character: a hedgehog. Readers are immediately drawn into Henry’s story as he shares about how sad he is about his pet ladybug dying. Luckily, his parents and good friends support him and remind him that he isn’t alone. They, too, miss his ladybug. The main focal lesson found in the book is God cares about our sadness and is so close to us that he can count our tears. God is close to the brokenhearted. Isn’t that such a cool lesson to use to teach children? This would be an excellent book for a parent, counselor, or teacher to use in the classroom. The back of the book has talking points that you can use with your child or class. My favorite part is the Back Pocket Bible Verses found at the back of the book. These are a great way to encourage kids to memorize the Scriptures and to look back on when they are sad. Oh, and even though the story is about || 15 || 5||\\nThis beautifully illustrated children&#039;s book invites kids to explore God&#039;s design for ethnic diversity and challenges readers both parents and children to learn and live out counter-cultural, biblical views, fostering a lifelong celebration of diversity for the glory of God. Designed for four- to eleven-year-olds, God Made Me and You by Shai Linne is the second book in the God Made Me series, starting with God Made All of Me by Justin and Lindsey Holcomb. For the first twenty-three years of my life, I lived in a small town that was 95% white and attended a church that was 100% white. Upon the completion of seminary, I moved to a larger metro area that was 56% white and a church that was less than 1% white. An older German lady. And now me. Suddenly I had to deal with ethnic diversity. Not only that, but in certain prominent contexts of my life, I was now undergoing the experience of a minority. And it was life-changing. Five years later, I still work in a predominantly Asian church and am the adoptive father to a Black son and we’re pursuing further adoptions. It wasn’t that I was uninterested in racial reconciliation before. This was a great conversation starter. It was a great way to show the boys that God made us all different, yet we are all made in his image. This book is such a great way to introduce kids to diversity. Beautifully written and illustrated. The boys really loved this book. Helping kids (and parents!) engage with the beauty of God’s design for ethnic diversity. God is not “colorblind”, nor should we be. Though I’m no connoisseur, Shai Linne is one of my favorite hip-hop artists and to have him bring his lyrical artistry to my children is a delight. New Growth Press has recently published a variety of really good options along this line. They are delightfully illustrated, cleverly told, engaging books that my youngest daughter asks for repeatedly, and my second youngest now picks off the shelf to read on her own (she’s a beginning reader.) These books provide great source material for dealing with hard topics (failure, anger, fear, ethnic diversity, and marveling at God’s creativity!) and provides parents with guides for discussion along these topics. My girls also love the tear-out pocket bible verses included in each. The best part about these stories, is that they aim at pointing a child to Christ in faith, rather than simple behavior modification and moralism, in accessible ways. Oh, and the messages of the books are good reminders and encouragement for me, the parent, as well. :) You may be familiar with Christian artist Shai Linne by way of the rap music he&#039;s produced over the years. My husband and I have enjoyed his songs are thankful for his being a light in a dark industry. We were especially thrilled when we found out that Shai Linne had a children&#039;s book coming out and couldn&#039;t wait to read it with our daughter. God Made Me and You: Celebrating God&#039;s Design for Ethnic Diversity tells the story of young students whose teacher helps them understand diversity from a biblical perspective. This book is fun not only because of the captivating illustrations but because, in true Shai Linne form, it is written in rhyme. I am thankful for the timely and important message of God Made Me and You which is that all humans have been created as image bearers of God and have equal value, dignity, and worth. This is an especially important resource because it allows parents to make diversity one of the earliest values they instill in their children. The way in which Shai Linne writes about diversity is easy for children to understand and his approach to the topic is unique as it points to I am always on the lookout for children&#039;s books, especially ones that talk about diversity. My children range from 3-10 and they honestly don&#039;t talk about the differences in skin color or the different cultures. It may be that we&#039;ve talked about it so much from their little years on up and even have a teen girl from a different culture living with us. Nevertheless, I still want to remind them constantly that God made everyone for the job He created them to do. This book fits the message I want my kids to know. For starters, I tend to look at the Editorial reviews of a book, especially a Christian book. When I see some of the names that I highly respect, I know it&#039;s a book I need to read. It&#039;s not always one I may agree with, but it&#039;s one I need to read. In this book, it was both....a book I needed to read and agreed with. The illustrations are cute and fun. The story is biblical. Shai reminds the children that God created a diverse group of people for unity. In a culture where disunity is taught and encouraged, he reminds them that&#039;s not God&#039;s || 18 || 5||\\n'],\n",

Eating plenty of it on a regular basis is thought to help shield you from a range of serious diseases including cancer, heart disease, depression and arthritis. They’re packed with vitamins and minerals, and are a significant source of omega-3 fatty acids. Whilst at face value, some fish can have a fair amount of fat, they’re the types of fats you want in your diet. And it’s a great, clean source of protein, vitamins, and minerals too. The baked sea bass I enjoyed at La Terraza di Lucollo is a fantastic source of Protein (c. 23 grams per 100 grams), it’s very low in sodium, with 0 carbs and trans fats. Each 100g is a mere 97 calories, 80% of which comes from Protein. It’s super low in saturated fat (less than 1g per 100g), and it’s a good source of Phosphorus (for strong teeth & bones), iron (to transport oxygen in the blood to all cells and muscles, helping to prevent fatigue), and Vitamin B12 and Zinc (helps release energy from food). Recipe Grilled sea bass with a zesty herb sauce Ingredients: 3 Tablespoons Olive Oil 2 Seabass||\\nQUORN BOLOGNESE ! || SAUCE: Ingredients (serves 2) 1. 10 ripe tomatoes 2. Large handful of fresh basil 3. Pinch of pink salt 4. Pinch of chilli powder 5. 2 cloves of garlic 6. (optional) 1/2 onion SAUCE: How to? 1. Start by de-seeding the tomatoes and chopping them into 4 pieces. 2. Pop the tomatoes into a food blender. I used my Vitamix. Personally I prefer the consistency to have some tomato components in it so only mix for a short few seconds. If your prefer a smooth texture, mix for longer. 3. Thinly slice the garlic and the onion and fry for a few minutes in coconut oil along with a tbsp of fresh basil. Make sure it doesn’t burn. 4. Add the tomatoes, a pinch of chilli and pink salt and let simmer for 10 minutes 5. Once it’s finished add another large chunk of fresh basil and prepare to add it to the below… QUORN BOLOGNESE: Ingredients (serves 2) 1/2 yellow onion 1 fresh chilli 300 grams of Quorn meat-free mince Homemade tomato sauce 250 grams of spaghetti 50g kidney beans BOLOGNESE: How To? 1.

Mix in a bowl with the yoghurt, lemon and mustard. Chop the chives and sprinkle into the mix. Grate a half an apple Add a pinch of pink salt and pepper, and mix it all together in the bowl. Place an amount onto the Oatcake, and finally, I like to add a thin slice of grapefruit of top with a sprig of dill, but it’s completely optional! Mackerel contains an abundance of heathy fats and protein, which is great for both skin and hair. Its also a perfect post workout spread as mackerel is rich in protein, omega-3s, and vitamins A and D, and a very good source of selenium – all of which the body needs by way of replenishment! 2) CORN SALSA DIP Ingredients 1 tin of Baby corn ½ Red onion Circa 8 finely chopped fresh baby tomatoes Bunch of Chives Pepper & Pink salt How to? Start||\\nMINCE PIES OUT; EXOTIC FRUIT SALAD IN !!! || 1) MANGO Has zero saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium, is a great source of dietary fibre (aids digestion) and Vitamin B6 (helps in maintaining normal nerve function). It’s also been shown as important for neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which will make you feel happy! Admittedly, very sweet and therefore a large portion of the 200 calories in a mango are from sugars (15 g per 100g is sugar) – so caution, to be eaten in moderation. 2) FIGS Luscious little fruits, rich in texture and flavour, boasting a chewy flesh and a crunchy seed, are high in dietary fibre (11% of each fig), high in potassium (which helps normalise blood pressure), and have been shown to lower triglyceride (fat) circulation in the blood. 3) RAMBUTAN Super-exotic, it’s very high in vitamin C (a 100-gram portion contains c.40 percent of your RDA). It’s also a great source of niacin (also known as vitamin B3). Inside this hairy fruit, aside from a high concentration of vitamin C, you’ll find other vital compounds required by the body every day – iron, phosphorus, protein and carbohydrates. 4) PAPAYA Fantastic for healthy, glowing skin since it’s a very dense source of Vitamin A||\\n'],\n",

In this harsh environment, Ernest Holm (Michael Shannon) tries to raise his two children, but a feud with a rancher leads to a life-threatening situation for everyone. Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult co-star.

Violet Wister (Greta Gerwig) is a natural-born leader. Together with the help of her conscientious friend Rose (Megalyn Echikunwoke) and their gorgeous pal Heather (Carrie MacLemore), Violet uses aroma and musical therapy to help her possibly suicidal classmates. When newly arrived transfer student Lily (Analeigh Tipton) seeks admission into their social circle, she's welcomed with open arms. While Lily appreciates having a group to be a part of, she soon realizes that Violet may not be a flawless friend.~Jason Buchanan||\\nThe Hangover Part III || R || The Wolfpack set out in search of Mr. Chow after Doug is kidnapped by a criminal seeking to recover $21 million from the diminutive hustler as the decadent Hangover trilogy winds to an outrageous close.

Kennedy shocked the nation and the world. The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bandied about, and these have supported a sizeable publishing mini-industry ever since. In making this movie, director Oliver Stone had his pick of supposed or real investigative flaws to draw from and constructed what some reviewers felt was one of the most compelling (and controversial) political detective thrillers ever to emerge from American cinema. Long before filming was completed, Stone was fending off heated accusations of artistic and historical irresponsibility, and these only intensified after the film was released. In the story, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald (Gary Oldman), and he sets out to||\\nHope Springs || PG-13 || Not a sequel to 1998's Hope Floats, Hope Springs is a romantic comedy based on the 2001 novel New Cardiff, the first new book in over 20 years by Charles Webb, author of The Graduate. Directed and written for the screen by Mark Herman (Brassed Off), the film stars Colin Firth as lovelorn British artist Colin Ware. After being left by his fiancée Vera (Minnie Driver), Colin takes to sulking about in a small Vermont hotel run by Joanie Fisher (Mary Steenburgen). When Joanie becomes aware of Colin's broken heart, she decides to match him up with a local woman named Mandy (Heather Graham). But just as romance begins to ensue between Colin and Mandy, Vera suddenly pops back into the picture with intentions of rekindling her relationship with Colin. Oliver Platt heads up the supporting cast that also includes Frank Collison and Chad Faust.~Matthew Tobey||\\n\"],\n",
